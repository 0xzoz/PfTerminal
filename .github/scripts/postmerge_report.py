"""Keep one labelled issue open while postmerge-ci is red on main (#1697).

postmerge-ci runs overlap on main (each gets its own v8-canary group, #1696),
so a run's report can arrive after a newer commit's. Each red report records
its run and failed jobs in a hidden marker on the issue. A failure counts as
fixed once a later main run (by creation time, which follows push order) ran
that same job and it passed, or once a re-run of the failed run itself passed
it (a re-run keeps the run id; the jobs listing shows the latest attempt). A
job that a later run skipped, such as the V8 matrix on a commit that doesn't
touch V8, proves nothing. So:

- a red run whose failed jobs all passed in a later run is stale: no comment,
  no new issue;
- a green run closes the issue only when every recorded failure has been
  fixed that way and no newer main run is still in progress (that run's
  report decides instead).

Only markers posted by github-actions[bot] count, and malformed ones are
skipped: the issue is public. The report job has no concurrency group (a
single-slot group cancelled pending reports), so reports race:

- if two red reports open an issue at once, the newer duplicate is closed and
  its markers are copied to the kept issue first;
- a red report that comments on an issue a green report has just closed
  reopens it, and a green report that finds a new marker after closing the
  issue reopens it.
