//! Timing of the shared state DB's write lock.
//!
//! The state DB is shared by every Corbanu process on a home, and SQLite has
//! one write lock per database: while one connection holds it, every other
//! writer waits (up to the 5 s busy timeout) and then fails with
//! SQLITE_BUSY. [`begin_immediate`] takes the lock like
//! `pool.begin_with("BEGIN IMMEDIATE")` and logs, under `codex_state::db_lock`,
//! how long the lock took to get and how long it was held, with the caller's
//! source location. A hold longer than [`SLOW_HOLD`] is a warning: it is what
//! makes other sessions wait.
