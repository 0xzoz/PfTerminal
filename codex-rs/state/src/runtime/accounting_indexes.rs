//! Lookup indexes on the ledger's attempts that its migrations do not create.
//!
//! Every ledger write reads the owner's day of attempts (`check_day`) and asks
//! whether anything is due to expire. Both select attempts by fields inside
//! their JSON payload, so without these indexes each write scanned and parsed
//! every attempt in the ledger while holding the state DB's write lock: on a
//! 61,000-attempt ledger that held the lock for 0.3-2 s per write, and every
//! other session waited. With them, the same statements are index lookups.
//!
//! They are created here, idempotently, rather than by a ledger migration: a
//! migration raises the ledger's format, and a build that knows only the older
//! format would then refuse the ledger (no collection, and no conversation
//! deletion). An index changes no record and no result, and builds that do not
//! know these indexes neither use nor mind them. A ledger migration that
//! rebuilds `draft_accounting_attempts` drops them with it; they are created
//! again on the next open.
