//! PF-25-S02: the human revocation and kill switch confirmed in `/security`.
//!
//! The only caller is the trusted TUI, after a person pressed the confirm key
//! on a review screen, as for [`super::level_change`]: no `Op`, app-server
//! method, tool or model output reaches this module.
//!
//! - One grant: it ends now ([`revoke_grant`]). Grants live in memory only,
//!   so there is nothing to save.
//! - All active authority and the kill switch go through PF-23-S03's
//!   transition: they apply now to the session's policy tree and the other
//!   trees of this process on the home (grants, "for session" approvals,
//!   broker channels end), and are saved in `security_state.json`, so revoked
//!   authority never comes back and the kill switch holds after a restart.
//!   Only the kill switch the person saw can be turned off, and turning it
//!   off keeps the level (`TransitionKind::KillSwitchRelease`).
//!
//! The commit blocks for up to the store's lock wait (2 s); call it off the
//! async runtime.
