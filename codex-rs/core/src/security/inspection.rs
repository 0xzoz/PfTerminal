//! PF-41-S01: read-only runtime facts for the `/security` inspector.
//!
//! [`observe`] reports what this process enforces right now, apart from what
//! configuration asks for: the live policy tree and its agents, held grants,
//! the session's taint, the process-wide launch, output and credential
//! controls, and recent denials. Nothing here changes authority: there is no
//! way to raise, lower, grant, revoke or clear a stop through this module.
//!
//! Every value is secret-free by construction: levels, counters, thread ids,
//! timestamps and fixed text. Grant ids, actor tokens, nonces, paths,
//! commands and free-form error text are never returned.
