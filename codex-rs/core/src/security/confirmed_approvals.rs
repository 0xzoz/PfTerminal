//! Issue #505: confirming Aggressive in `/security` requires a person's
//! approval for every command that is not known read-only, from each
//! thread's next turn, before the restart that loads the rest of Aggressive.
//!
//! At confirmation every session of this process on the Corbanu home gets
//! the approval policy `untrusted` with you as the reviewer in its stored
//! settings, as a thread settings update would. Steering, child-agent
//! messages, MCP approvals and `/status` all read that one value. Sessions
//! that start later in this process on the home start with it. Until the
//! restart it holds: a later settings update (a client replaying its old
//! values) cannot lower it.
//!
//! A managed requirement that rules out either value keeps the session's own
//! settings; nothing overrides it, and the person is told in that thread.
//!
//! Only this process is covered: `corbanu exec`, IDE sessions and other
//! processes on the home get Aggressive's approvals when they start under
//! it. Internal sessions (reviews, compaction, memory) keep their own.
