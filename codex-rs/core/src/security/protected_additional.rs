//! Issue #245: a command's additional permissions never reopen a protected
//! path. The sandbox gives the most specific entry precedence, so an extra
//! read of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` would override the PF-23 denial of `~/.ssh`
//! wherever the request was approved (a person, Guardian, a hook, the
//! approval cache, or a session or turn grant).
//!
//! Under Moderate and Aggressive, wherever the protected-path rules apply to
//! a run, a request whose additional permissions open a protected path is
//! refused and explained, and a permission grant (`request_permissions`)
//! never carries such entries into later commands or file tools. Where
//! Moderate lets a person's approval lift the rules for one command (issue
//! #239), nothing changes for reads. Permissive has no rules and is
//! unchanged.
//!
//! Issue #513: the same for the PF-23-S02 write protections. A write entry
//! equal to a read-only path wins the tie, a narrower one wins outright, and
//! a broader one opens a path the profile itself could not write (the
//! read-only rule is only added where it could). So additional write
//! permissions never make writable:
//! - the Corbanu home's runtime entries (`tmp` holds the sandbox launchers),
//!   under Moderate and Aggressive, even where an approval lifted the other
//!   rules, and never with a grant (#442);
//! - under Aggressive, the project's `.codex` and `.agents`, never with a
//!   grant either (#520), refused before anyone is asked (#565);
//! - under Aggressive, the other read-only paths (start-up files, git hooks
//!   and config) unless an Aggressive grant for the run lifted them;
//! - under Moderate, the other read-only paths and the project's `.codex`
//!   and `.agents` unless a person's fresh approval of
//!   this command allowed it (Travis, 2026-10-11): not the automatic
//!   reviewer, a permission hook, a remembered approval or a stored grant.
//!   Grants never carry them, at either level.
