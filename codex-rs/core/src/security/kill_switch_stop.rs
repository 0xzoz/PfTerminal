//! Issue #507: turning the security kill switch on stops what is already
//! running, in every session of this process on the Corbanu home (each pane,
//! and the child agents they started), not only the next turn (#445).
//!
//! - The turn in progress is interrupted: a reply still streaming is
//!   cancelled, approvals it is waiting for end, and the commands it started
//!   are stopped with it.
//! - Background terminals (unified exec processes) and an open realtime
//!   conversation are ended too.
//! - A tool call that reaches the router while the switch is on is not run
//!   ([`refuse_tool_call`]), so nothing slips through between the switch and
//!   the interruption.
//!
//! Another Corbanu Terminal process running on the same home takes the saved
//! switch within about a second (#507, Travis 2026-10-12: its watch of the
//! saved state, `effective_policy::transition::kill_switch_watch`) and stops
//! its work the same way.
//!
//! Agent messages that arrive while the switch is on keep waiting (#445): no
//! turn starts for them until a person turns the switch off.
