//! #826 (Travis, 2026-10-15) and its #876 follow-up: on Linux, agent
//! commands under Moderate and Aggressive (also where only the launch
//! enforces Aggressive) cannot create user namespaces. [`rule_applies`] is
//! the orchestrator's decision; the rest names the rule where a command that
//! needed one failed (to the person, to the model and in the inspector's
//! recent denials) and before a person approves a command that needs one.
//!
//! Explanations only: nothing here changes what runs or lifts the rule,
//! but for D27 (a) (Travis, 2026-10-19, security sign-off): under Moderate,
//! a person's fresh approval of a command's request to run outside the
//! sandbox before untrusted content ([`allows_one_run`]) also lets that one
//! run create user namespaces, with [`one_run_warning`] in the prompt.
//! D48 (c) (Travis, 2026-10-20, security sign-off): after untrusted content,
//! the same, through a fresh prompt with the same warning, but only for a
//! command whose program is a known tool ([`known_tool::known_tool`]).
//! Never remembered; Aggressive and an Aggressive launch keep the rule.
