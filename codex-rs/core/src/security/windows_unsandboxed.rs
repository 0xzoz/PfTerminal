//! #1976 (D491, option (a)): on Windows, Moderate and Aggressive keep agent
//! commands and file tools away from protected files only through the
//! default (elevated) Windows sandbox. Without any Windows sandbox, commands
//! Windows treats as read-only and in-process file tools would run with no
//! sandbox at all, so under those levels both are refused, saying which level
//! and how to set the sandbox up. The session still starts, so a person can
//! set the sandbox up or change the level. Permissive is unchanged, and so is
//! the non-admin sandbox, which already refuses the levels' deny-read
//! profiles (#300). The level is the session's live one: every config layer,
//! the stored level and the Aggressive recovery of an unreadable store
//! (`Config::security_level`), raised by the live policy.
