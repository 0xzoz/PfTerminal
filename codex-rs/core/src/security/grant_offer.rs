//! PF-25-S01: one Aggressive grant, offered by Core while it waits for the
//! human's answer to one exact command, and confirmed only in the TUI.
//!
//! Under Aggressive a human approval never lifts the protected-path rules
//! (PF-23-S02); a matching grant does. While a command approval is open,
//! Core records an offer: the command, its folder, the agent lineage (actor
//! chain) and session it runs in, and the policy epoch. The offer is data,
//! never authority. [`confirm`], called by the TUI's grant review after the
//! person chose "Grant", only records their choice on the offer. The
//! orchestrator applies it, and only when that same approval comes back
//! approved: then this command runs once without the rules ("1 run", never
//! held), or the grant is held for any run of the exact command until it
//! expires ([`GRANT_LIFETIME_SECONDS`]). A declined, cancelled or abandoned
//! approval ends the offer and the choice with it.
//!
//! No `Op`, app-server method, tool or model output reaches [`confirm`]; the
//! issuer is the human principal of the session's live policy, never a field
//! of the offer; and the grant names the actor chain of the session that
//! asked, so its parent, siblings and other sessions gain nothing. Grants
//! live in memory only ([`super::aggressive`]): a level change, revocation,
//! kill switch or restart ends them.
