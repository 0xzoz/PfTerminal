//! #748: under security level Moderate, a command the sandbox stopped because
//! of Moderate's protected-path rules says so where it failed, to the person
//! (a warning) and to the model (a note on the output), as #442 does under
//! Aggressive. Without it both saw only "Operation not permitted".
//!
//! Only a denial the rules add counts: the path is one they protect, and the
//! person's own permissions (the profile without the rules) allow the access.
//! A write outside the project, a network failure or the person's own denial
//! is not Moderate's and is not attributed to it. A path the secretless
//! launch contract also keeps at every level is attributed to that contract
//! (a person's approval may have lifted Moderate's rules for the command).
//! Otherwise the way forward is switching to Permissive, unless the person's
//! own full access runs commands outside a sandbox, which the contract
//! refuses at every level. Nothing is said about approvals lifting the rules
//! (#747). Explanation only: it never changes what runs or what is denied.
