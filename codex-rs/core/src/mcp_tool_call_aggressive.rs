//! D52 (#1001, Travis 2026-10-20): MCP "always approve" under security
//! level Aggressive, like remembered command approvals (#626).
//!
//! An MCP tool whose approval mode resolves to `approve` (a person's "Allow
//! and don't ask me again", or a setting in a config file) runs unasked. While
//! Aggressive is in force that is suspended, not deleted: the tool is treated
//! as if it had no such setting (asked as usual) and the question says why,
//! unless a person chose "Allow and don't ask me again" for it while
//! Aggressive was in force. Those tools are recorded in the Corbanu home's
//! [`FILE`], the only place trusted to say so (under Aggressive the Corbanu
//! home is read-only to agent commands). Moderate and Permissive are
//! unchanged.
