//! #878: which brokered requests the model-key broker refused, per session.
//!
//! The inspector shows the model-key broker as degraded while the last
//! brokered request of the inspected session (or one of its agents), or of
//! this process outside any session (the model list, the wallet), was
//! refused. Every refusal counts: a provider URL the broker cannot bind, a
//! credential it cannot register (no key, a store it cannot read, a broker
//! that is gone or rejects it), a request it cannot sign, and a request the
//! broker itself denies. Only a later request of the same owner that the
//! broker serves clears it.
