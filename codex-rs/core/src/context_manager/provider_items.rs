//! #578: history items another provider produced, prepared for the provider a
//! request goes to.
//!
//! A session can switch providers between turns. Model output items carry
//! provider-bound state: reasoning (encrypted for one organization, signed by
//! one Anthropic-compatible host, or plain text a Chat host streamed), item
//! IDs a stateful host could look up, and hosted-tool records. A Responses
//! request with `store: false` can only read an item ID as a reference to an
//! item that host stored, so another provider's reasoning there fails every
//! later turn with `404 Item with id 'rs_…' not found`.
//!
//! Model output items record the provider (and named account) that produced
//! them ([`ResponseItem::producer`]). Before a request is built:
//! - Items from the same provider are sent as they are, so its requests and
//!   prompt cache are unchanged.
//! - Another provider's items are adapted to the target wire:
//!   - Responses: its reasoning, hosted web searches, image generations and
//!     remote-compaction summaries are dropped (another host's encrypted or
//!     plain reasoning and summaries cannot be sent to a Responses host, only
//!     referenced; Chat and Anthropic requests leave them out too); its other
//!     items keep their content but lose their IDs and encrypted function
//!     arguments, so they are sent inline, never as references. The IDs are
//!     removed by the client ([`strip_foreign_references`]) after source
//!     labelling, which looks items up by their recorded bytes.
//!   - Anthropic: its reasoning (another host's signed thinking) and
//!     web-search blocks are dropped. Messages and tool calls carry no item
//!     IDs on this wire.
//!   - Chat Completions: unchanged. This wire sends no item IDs or encrypted
//!     state; reasoning text is sent inline where the model replays it.
//! - Items with no recorded producer (sessions recorded before #578, or items
//!   the host built itself) are left as they are, except what a
//!   `store: false` Responses request could only send as a reference:
//!   reasoning or a compaction with no encrypted content, or an Anthropic
//!   thinking block. Those are dropped, and so are Anthropic web-search
//!   blocks.
//!
//! The producer is the provider id and named account, not the model: a model
//! switch inside one multi-vendor gateway (Vercel, OpenRouter) is not a
//! provider switch. Encrypted content inside local items (agent mail, tool
//! outputs) carries no producer and is sent as before.
