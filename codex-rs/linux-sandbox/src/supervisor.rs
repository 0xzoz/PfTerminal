//! #935 (Travis, 2026-10-19, D35 option A): a bubblewrap sandbox cannot
//! outlive the helper that started it.
//!
//! bubblewrap binds the sandbox's PID 1 to its parent with
//! `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` only after setting the sandbox up, and never checks
//! that the parent is still alive afterwards. When the outer bubblewrap dies
//! before then (the helper killed during setup, a credential stop, a crash),
//! PID 1 keeps running with PPID 1 in its own session, and so does the
//! command it starts.
//!
//! So the helper runs bubblewrap under a supervisor: a fork of the helper in
//! its own process group (out of reach of a kill aimed at the helper's; its
//! own session for a command run without bubblewrap), set as a child
//! subreaper. Every orphaned sandbox PID 1 becomes its child. It
//! stops the sandbox when bubblewrap exits or when its lifeline from the
//! helper closes (the helper exited or was killed, saw its own parent exit,
//! or stopped the command): it kills bubblewrap and every remaining child
//! with `SIGKILL`, which for a PID 1 takes its whole PID namespace with it
//! (double-forked daemons included), and reaps them all before exiting with
//! bubblewrap's status.
//!
//! #1006 (Travis, 2026-10-20, D47 option B): a command run without
//! bubblewrap (full disk write access without managed-proxy routing, legacy
//! Landlock) runs under the same supervisor, in place of bubblewrap. There is
//! no PID namespace, but every process the command leaves behind is the
//! supervisor's descendant, and an orphaned one becomes its child: killing
//! its children, listing them again and repeating stops the whole tree. The
//! command keeps the helper's process group (see [`Relay`]).
