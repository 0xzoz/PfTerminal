//! PF-27-S05: Core's model-provider credentials held by the isolated
//! credential broker (feature `broker_model_auth`).
//!
//! Core installs one [`ModelKeyBroker`] per process. From then on every auth
//! this crate resolves for a plain provider key or sign-in token is a
//! brokered auth provider: it signs each request for the broker, which
//! attaches the credential. That covers the model client, web search, image
//! generation and the model catalog, which all resolve auth here.
//!
//! - Provider env-key providers are never read by Core: [`ConfiguredModelProvider`]
//!   hands out [`BROKERED_KEY_PLACEHOLDER`] instead of the key, and the broker
//!   uses the variable Core handed over at startup, else reads the stored key
//!   (encrypted vault, then the legacy file) itself.
//! - An OpenAI API-key login, `experimental_bearer_token` and a ChatGPT access
//!   token are values Core already holds; they are handed to the broker, and
//!   Core never attaches them to a request itself.
//! - Header-only uses of a first-party login ([`crate::auth_provider_from_auth`]:
//!   MCP uploads, plugins, skills, analytics, backend clients) cannot carry a
//!   signed frame, so they get no credential.
//!
//! Not brokered: agent identity, header and command auth, AWS auth.
//!
//! [`ConfiguredModelProvider`]: crate::create_model_provider
