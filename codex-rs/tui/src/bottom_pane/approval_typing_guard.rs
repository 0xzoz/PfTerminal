//! Keeps typed or pasted text from answering an approval prompt.
//!
//! Someone who believes the composer is focused types a word into the prompt.
//! When characters answered it, the first letter picked an option: typing
//! `/permissions` approved with "don't ask again" through `p`. Characters
//! therefore never answer on their own. A decision key only highlights its
//! option and Enter confirms it, so the prompt is answered by exactly one
//! decision key then Enter, by navigation then Enter, by a chord shortcut for
//! an option that answers only this request, or cancelled with Esc. Any other input (a second character, an unbound
//! character, a paste, editing keys) is typed text: Enter is ignored and the
//! prompt explains how to answer until the user navigates with the arrow,
//! Page, Home or End keys. No timing is involved.
//!
//! The prompt right after a character command key such as open thread needs
//! navigation before Enter confirms, since its following keys may be a word.
//!
//! Options that last beyond this request ("don't ask again", session scope)
//! are never chosen by a key: their key only explains that the arrow keys
//! choose them, and Enter stays blocked until the user navigates.
//!
//! #787: the bottom pane also drops every key but Ctrl+C that reaches a
//! request before it is drawn or in the second after (see
//! `REQUEST_INPUT_GUARD`), since those keys were meant for whatever was on
//! screen before. The prompt then says so and needs navigation before Enter
//! ([`TypingGuard::on_early_input`]). #817: that guard is the only one for a
//! request coming on screen (a new request, the next of a queue, one revealed
//! or held back while the user typed): once its second has passed with no key
//! dropped, a deliberate Enter confirms the highlighted option.
