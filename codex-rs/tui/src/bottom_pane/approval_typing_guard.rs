//! Keeps typed or pasted text from answering an approval prompt.
//!
//! Someone who believes the composer is focused types a word into the prompt.
//! When characters answered it, the first letter picked an option: typing
//! `/permissions` approved with "don't ask again" through `p`. Characters
//! therefore never answer on their own. A decision key only highlights its
//! option and Enter confirms it, so the prompt is answered by exactly one
//! decision key then Enter, by navigation then Enter, by a chord shortcut for
//! an option that answers only this request, or cancelled with Esc. Any other input (a second character, an unbound
//! character, a paste, editing keys) is typed text: Enter is ignored and the
//! prompt explains how to answer until the user navigates with the arrow,
//! Page, Home or End keys. No timing is involved.
//!
//! Some prompts need a fresh choice (a decision key or navigation) before
//! Enter confirms: a request reached by answering or replacing the previous
//! one, so a double or held Enter cannot answer a request the user has not
//! seen; a prompt that was held back while the user typed, whose next Enter
//! may be meant for their draft; and the prompt right after a character
//! command key such as open thread, whose following keys may be a word.
//!
//! Options that last beyond this request ("don't ask again", session scope)
//! are never chosen by a key: their key only explains that the arrow keys
//! choose them, and Enter stays blocked until the user navigates.
