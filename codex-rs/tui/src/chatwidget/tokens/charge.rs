//! How `/cost` prices a request on a route that reports its charge (#368).
//!
//! Travis, 2026-10-14: OpenRouter first, then the Vercel AI Gateway and the
//! Corbanu API by the same rule. These routes state what they charged with each
//! response (`usage.cost` or the gateway's own figure, recorded as
//! `billed_usd`), and that charge is exact where a catalogue rate is not:
//! OpenRouter's price depends on which upstream endpoint served the request.
//! So a request is priced from that charge. Without one, the catalogue rate
//! bound at dispatch stands, shown as an estimate; with neither, there is no
//! price.
//!
//! The ledger is unchanged: its quote keeps the catalogue estimate and the
//! charge stays in the attempt's usage. This view puts the charge in as the
//! attempt's figure before anything is summed, so every total, page and link
//! reads the same amount, and each page says which basis it used.
