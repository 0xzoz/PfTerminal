//! #826 follow-up (#876, #891): on Linux, agent commands under security
//! levels Moderate and Aggressive (and contained Claude panes under them)
//! cannot create user namespaces. A command that needed one fails with a
//! bare "Operation not permitted"; this names the rule instead.
//!
//! Text only: nothing here decides what runs. A match adds an explanation to
//! a command that already failed under the rule.
//!
//! D27 (a) (Travis, 2026-10-19, security sign-off): under Moderate a person
//! may allow it for one command, by approving that command's request to run
//! outside the sandbox before untrusted content enters the session
//! ([`moderate_one_run_warning`] is what they are told). Aggressive, and a
//! launch that enforces Aggressive, never allow it.
