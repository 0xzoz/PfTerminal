//! Issue #536 (Travis, 2026-10-12): a writable root must not follow a link
//! made after the session started, nor a link that leads outside the
//! writable roots holding it, at every level (Permissive included).
//!
//! The escape: a writable root that is configured but does not exist yet,
//! inside another writable root (`ws/target`), is created by a command as a
//! link (`ln -s /elsewhere ws/target`); from the next command on, write
//! access followed the link.
//!
//! Each writable root's real location (every link followed, see
//! [`real_location`]) is recorded the first time this process sees it,
//! normally when the session starts ([`record_writable_roots`]). Before each
//! sandboxed command ([`check_writable_roots`]) the command is refused, with
//! a message naming the link, when a root:
//! - leads through a link somewhere else than where it led when recorded;
//! - is held by another writable root and leads outside every root holding
//!   it (also a link left from an earlier session).
//!
//! A root first seen after the session started (added by a permission
//! request, or another working folder) is recorded then; it gets the second
//! check and the pinning, but no comparison with the session's start.
//!
//! The sandboxes then grant writes at the location checked here (the
//! [`PinnedWritableRoot`]s, and [`pinned_real_location`] for Seatbelt), not
//! wherever the root leads by the time they are set up, so a link swapped in
//! after the check grants nothing.
//!
//! A root that leads through no link any more (the person removed it, or a
//! real folder took its place) is recorded where it is and runs again. A
//! root's record lives as long as the process.
