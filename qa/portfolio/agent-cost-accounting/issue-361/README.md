# #361: OpenAI API-key prices, cache writes and long-context tier (2026-10-09)

**Result.** A real `gpt-5.6-luna` request on the OpenAI API key (vault `openai-api-key`, developer-accounting build of
this branch, disposable home) shows `/cost` "Known subtotal exact USD: 0.0062586". The independent recompute from the
provider-reported usage at OpenAI's published Standard rates is **$0.0062586**: equal to the micro-dollar, with no
"had no price" attempt.

## Classification

- **Initiative.** Work under the active PF-60 product initiative
  ([plan](../../../../docs/plans/active/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting.md)). Product spec heading **Product
  measurement**, as the plan cites it: "No commercial performance numbers have been supplied." It fixes the PF-60-S05
  AC10 failure found by the re-run: "Pay-per-use estimates match an independent recomputation at the provider's
  published prices to the micro-dollar."
- **Persistent state.** A price record with a long-context tier needs ledger format 3 (migration 0003). The first
  OpenAI attempt on a model with a tier (GPT-5.6, GPT-6, GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4), API key or ChatGPT login, upgrades the
  ledger. An older developer build sharing that state DB then refuses the ledger and turns collection off for its
  session ("newer ledger format"), as with format 2. Nothing is deleted or re-priced. Release records must carry this.

## Prices

- **Source.** https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing (Standard table) and
  https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/<slug>, read 2026-10-09 ~19:35Z with curl
  ([data/openai-pricing-20261009.txt](data/openai-pricing-20261009.txt)).
- **Catalogue.** `codex-rs/models-manager/models.json` is hand-maintained, not generated: the upstream
  `rust-release-prepare` workflow that refreshes it is gated to `openai/codex` and its source (the ChatGPT models
  endpoint) carries no Corbanu billing. `scripts/check_openai_api_prices.py` now compares the catalogue with the page.
- **Rows.** Standard rates, cache writes where the sheet lists them, and the long-context tier where the model page
  states one; see `MODEL-ECONOMICS-DATA.md` for the table.
- **History.** Rates are bound to each attempt when it is admitted, so earlier records keep the rates they were
  priced at. A row that states a cache-write rate or a long-context tier gets a new price identity (`stated-v1`);
  other rows keep theirs.

- **Chat Completions.** OpenAI's Chat API reports `prompt_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens` as a subset of the
  prompt (real probe: [data/openai-chat-usage-probe.jsonl](data/openai-chat-usage-probe.jsonl), 6,017 prompt, 6,014
  written, then 6,014 cached), so the `openai` Chat route now records it and prices writes too.
- **Assumptions.** GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.4's pages state only "2x input and 1.5x output" above 272K, so their cache reads
  above 272K are left unpriced. Sol's promotional price ends at the earliest reading of "through November 21, 2026"
  (2026-11-21T23:59:59.999Z); after that Sol API-key work shows "no price" until the page is read again (#368).

## Real check (macOS)

Run on commit `29204b2363` (the first commit of PR #369). The review fixes after it don't change how a Responses
request on `gpt-5.6-luna` is priced. Ledgers written by that first commit are not supported by later builds of this
branch if they hold an estimate with unknown input under a long-context tier (that case now reports missing usage).

| Step | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `corbanu exec -m gpt-5.6-luna "Reply with exactly the word: ok"` with `CODEX_API_KEY` from the vault on the command only | [data/exec-luna-t1.jsonl](data/exec-luna-t1.jsonl) |
| Provider usage, from the WebSocket frames (`tungstenite::protocol=trace`) | [data/provider-usage-luna-t1.jsonl](data/provider-usage-luna-t1.jsonl): prewarm 9,600 input; turn 17,331 input = 3 uncached + 17,328 cache writes, 5 output |
| Recompute at $0.20 / $0.02 / $0.25 cache writes / $1.20 | [data/recompute-luna-t1.txt](data/recompute-luna-t1.txt), [tools/recompute.py](tools/recompute.py): **$0.0062586** |
| `/cost` in the TUI (placeholder key, same home) | [captures/luna-t1-conv.txt](captures/luna-t1-conv.txt): exact USD 0.0062586; request 1 $0.001920, request 2 $0.004339 |
| Request 2 technical page | [captures/luna-t1-request2-technical.txt](captures/luna-t1-request2-technical.txt): rates 0.2 / 0.02 / 0.25 / 1.2, long-context tier 0.4 / 0.04 / 0.5 / 1.8 above 272,000 input tokens, "not applied: input 17331 ≤ 272000" |

**Safety.** `CORBANU_TEST_NO_NATIVE_KEYRING=1` and one disposable `CODEX_HOME`/`CORBANU_HOME`/`PFTERMINAL_HOME`.
The key was resolved by the installed wrapper only inside the consuming command; the TUI ran with a placeholder.
Logging was limited to `codex_api=trace,tungstenite::protocol=trace`. Key scan of the scratch directory and this
directory: 0 files with the key, 0 key-shaped strings.

## Other pay-per-use routes (same day)

| Route | Source | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `zai` (pay-as-you-go API) | docs.z.ai/guides/overview/pricing | GLM-5.3-Flash 0.15 / 0.03 / 0.50, GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.2 1.40 / 0.26 / 4.40; cache storage "limited-time free": **match** |
| `deepseek` | api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing | Flash 0.15 / 0.003 / 0.60 off-peak, 2x peak; V4-Pro 0.66 / 0.022 / 1.98 off-peak, 2x peak; windows 01-04 and 06-10 UTC Mon-Fri: **match**. Holiday dates are listed through 2026-10-07 only (follow-up). |
| `anthropic` (API key) | platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing | Opus 5.5 4 / 20 / 0.20, 5m writes 5; Opus 5 5 / 25 / 0.50, 6.25; Fable 5.1 10 / 50 / 0.25, 12.50; Fable 5 10 / 50 / 1, 12.50; no long-context surcharge for these: **match** |
| `openrouter` | openrouter.ai/api/v1/models and `/endpoints` | **Out of scope, follow-up.** The price depends on the upstream endpoint that served the request (e.g. `moonshotai/kimi-k3` input $0.65-$4.50 across endpoints), so one catalogue rate can't be right for every request. Listing mismatches: `x-ai/grok-4.7` 1.6 / 4.8 / 0.4 vs 2.0 / 6.0 / 0.5; `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` cached 0.05 vs 0.03; `minimax/minimax-m3` 0.6 / 2.4 vs 0.3 / 1.2 / 0.06; `moonshotai/kimi-k3` 3 / 15 / 0.3 vs 0.9 / 14 / 0.6 (cheapest); `tencent/hy3:free` no longer listed. |
| Moonshot / Kimi Open Platform (`api.moonshot.ai/v1`), BigModel (`open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4`) | platform.moonshot.ai/docs/pricing/chat; open.bigmodel.cn/pricing | No catalogue row prices these routes, so every attempt shows "no price" (never a wrong one). Adding them is a follow-up. |
