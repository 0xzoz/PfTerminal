# Re-verify PF-60-S03 from the repository

This checks the retained acceptance evidence; it cannot establish complete bills,
independent functional acceptance, or permission to ship. Start by reading
[the acceptance decision](../acct-acceptance-75/acceptance.md), especially the open
scope-zero finding and historical timeout. Treat recorded conclusions as claims.

**Get a clean copy.** Use Python 3, Git and Bash. Run this first block from the
root of the supplied repository. It records HEAD and creates a full-history,
detached clone of that commit. It does not copy the working tree.

**Source-status criterion and action.** Inspect the printed status before
proceeding. An empty status permits cloning. Any staged or unstaged tracked
change (including additions, deletions, renames and conflicts) must stop this
run: preserve the change, then either have the integrator commit the intended
candidate or use a separate clean checkout of the intended commit. Do not
silently discard changes or call a replay of HEAD a replay of those edits.

Untracked artifacts outside the evidence inventories and replay/build inputs,
and ignored scratch/cache outputs, may remain only when their omission cannot
change the claim being checked. Inspect the acceptance record's inventory
references and its input paths; a path's being ignored or untracked alone is
not sufficient. If a path is inventoried, supplies code/configuration/evidence,
is meant to change the candidate, or its relevance is uncertain, stop and
resolve it with the integrator before rerunning. Missing historical package
bytes remain unavailable even if a local ignored package exists.

For permissible omissions, preserve the status and record the paths and why
they are irrelevant in the transcript. Set `REPLAY_OMISSIONS_NOTE` to that
explanation in the shell running block 1, then rerun that block unchanged.
The block refuses tracked changes regardless of this explanation and refuses
untracked/ignored entries without it. Report the result as a replay of the
printed committed candidate, with listed omissions; never as verification of
the whole dirty source tree. No omissions means no explanation is needed.

The default destination is ignored scratch under this repository. To relocate
it or run a second attempt, set `CORBANU_AUDIT_DIR` to a new absolute path in
the shell running block 1. Preserve the old directory and transcripts; never
reuse or delete a prior attempt to make this block pass. A destination inside
the source repository must be ignored. A destination outside it is also valid.
An edited copy of this operator note may be supplied as an external frozen
instruction, with its hash recorded; do not copy it over the committed audit
files or imply that the candidate includes that edit.

```sh
set -eu
q=qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s03
test "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" = "$PWD"
candidate=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
printf 'Candidate: %s\n' "$candidate"
git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all --ignored=matching
if ! git diff --quiet HEAD -- || test -n "$(git ls-files --unmerged)"; then
    printf '%s\n' 'STOP: tracked source changes; preserve them and resolve the candidate.'
    exit 1
fi
omitted=$(git ls-files --others --exclude-standard --directory; git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard --directory)
if test -n "$omitted"; then
    printf 'Omitted paths:\n%s\n' "$omitted"
    if test -z "${REPLAY_OMISSIONS_NOTE:-}"; then
        printf '%s\n' 'STOP: classify omissions using the criterion above; record REPLAY_OMISSIONS_NOTE and rerun only if permissible.'
        exit 1
    fi
    printf 'Operator omission assessment: %s\n' "$REPLAY_OMISSIONS_NOTE"
fi
audit=${CORBANU_AUDIT_DIR:-"$PWD/$q/acct-criterion-97/target/audit-copy"}
case "$audit" in /*) ;; *) printf '%s\n' 'STOP: CORBANU_AUDIT_DIR must be absolute.'; exit 1 ;; esac
test ! -e "$audit" && test ! -L "$audit"
case "$audit" in "$PWD"/*) git check-ignore -v "$audit" ;; esac
git clone --no-local --no-checkout . "$audit"
git -C "$audit" checkout --detach "$candidate"
audit=$(cd "$audit" && pwd -P)
git -C "$audit" update-ref refs/heads/integrate/management-workstreams-20260911 "$candidate"
git -C "$audit" config --local corbanu.replayRoot "$audit"
git -C "$audit" config --local corbanu.replayCandidate "$candidate"
printf 'Run every remaining block from: %s\n' "$audit"
```

Run **each remaining block from the printed audit-copy root**, in a fresh Bash
shell (`bash --noprofile --norc`). Each block defines its own variables but
requires you to enter that directory first. Every remaining block checks the
root and candidate markers written to the clone's local Git config; a wrong
directory or changed HEAD stops before replay/build/test execution. These are
accidental-misrouting guards, not an independent authenticity claim.
The clone's integration ref is deliberately
re-pointed at the candidate because the replay script reads that fixed ref.
This makes the replay self-referential: candidate code and evidence are compared
with expected bytes and a digest committed in that same candidate. It proves
internal agreement, not agreement with an independently trusted integration tip
or historical release. The supplied repository's integration ref is unchanged.

```sh
set -eu
q=qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s03
test "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" = "$PWD"
test "$(git config --local --get corbanu.replayRoot)" = "$PWD"
test "$(git config --local --get corbanu.replayCandidate)" = "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
rc=0
python3 -B "$q/acct-inventory-79/verify_acceptance.py" || rc=$?
printf 'Acceptance exit: %s (expected 2)\n' "$rc"
test "$rc" -eq 2
python3 -B "$q/acct-inventory-79/check_verifier.py"
python3 -B "$q/acct-selfcheck-84/check_current_tip.py"
```

**Read the outputs, including exit status.** The verifier must end with `BASELINE MATCH` and
`RESULT agreement=20 disagreement=0 unavailable=3 exit=2`; process exit 2 is the
expected incomplete evidence result. It derives the bounded numeric, inventory,
capture and historical test claims. The control checker must exit 0 with all
13 cases passed. The separately invoked replay must exit 0, report
`stdout_matches_prior_replay: true`, unchanged clean status and identical resolved
commits, with nested acceptance/control exits 2/0 and empty stderr. Its
`run_directory` retains raw streams and receipt. It compares exact stdout against
committed expected bytes and their SHA-256; it is **not run automatically** by the
verifier or CI. None of these checks proves arbitrary prose or human approval.

**The three unavailable artifacts** are `codex`, `codex-code-mode-host` and
`rmcp_test_server` in `acct-fitness-76/package/`. They are ignored unsigned local
debug binaries, excluded for repository storage cost (about 680 MiB), not a
licensing prohibition. The manifest/build log are retained; their historical
binary bytes, modes and hashes cannot be verified from this clone. Read
[the exclusion record](../acct-baseline-81/package-exclusion.md). Rebuilding does
not prove historical identity; closing availability needs the exact retained
package from immutable artifact storage. Do not turn missing bytes into passes.

**Fresh Rust gates, if required.** Read
[credential isolation](../../../../../docs/development/test-isolation.md) and
[build setup](../../../../../docs/install.md#source-build). Before these blocks,
install Rust 1.95.0 (the pin in `codex-rs/rust-toolchain.toml`), `just`,
`cargo-nextest` and platform build tools described there. The first block runs
`cargo fetch --locked` while network access is available: this populates the
active Cargo home's registry and git dependency caches for the lockfile. On a
network-isolated host, transfer those caches from a trusted same-lockfile build
host first and replace that fetch with `cargo fetch --locked --offline`; record
that adaptation. Cargo's offline flag does not prevent build scripts fetching
external artifacts such as rusty_v8 archives; prepopulate those caches too for
a fully disconnected build. Never copy a Corbanu profile or credential files.

These blocks use the same dedicated target under `acct-criterion-97/target/`,
covered by the committed `*/target/` rule; the first block prints that match.
Build prerequisites first. Then run each test block separately, inspecting its
exit/log before dispatching the next. Stop successors on any native credential
prompt or live-profile read; never authorize it.

Require the exact banner
`Test isolation: disposable profile; native keyring disabled (debug lane)`
before every test lane, nonzero runs and zero failures/timeouts: the
recorded baseline is 124/124 default, 127/127 feature and 91/91 TUI (342 overlapping
executions), with 3545/3545/4078 skipped. Record fresh counts and failure names;
later passes never erase the retained round-66 timeout. Stop successors on any
native credential prompt or live-profile read; never authorize it.

**If replay disagrees:** preserve the candidate SHA, command, exit, receipt and
raw stdout/stderr before retrying. Read the acceptance exit table: 3 means drift
or refused baseline; 1/traceback is failed execution/check; missing history/ref is
a prerequisite failure. The comparison reference is
`qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s03/acct-reference-88/expected.stdout.txt`,
with digest `25450ea3837dfc7624189eb89f7067fda71b76dbec21e2853122875f03dd1fce`
in the adjacent `reference.json`, read from the candidate commit. Compare the
retained `acceptance.stdout.txt` against that file; compare candidate evidence
files and hashes with those in the supplied candidate SHA recorded at clone time.
This is the same self-referential consistency check described above, not an
independent historical reference. Restore accidental edits or send intentional claim/evidence changes to the
integrator for review, refreshing inventories and expected output/digest together
only after justification. Never regenerate expectations merely to pass. Keep
scope-zero, settlement, independent package/platform/profile and live-repository
gaps open until their separate evidence and authority requirements are met.
