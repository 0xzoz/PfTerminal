# Package exclusion

The three binaries are deliberately excluded local debug build products.

Attribution clarified on September 17, 2026 by the `acct-selfcheck-84`
`gpt-6-astra` high revise worker: retaining this exclusion is my own engineering
judgement in this QA lane. The earlier round-76 staging script and ignore rule
show the choice, but the retained record does not identify its original human
or agent decider or decision time. I cannot retrospectively attribute that choice
to Travis or Fable. This dated statement owns the present decision only.
The reasoning is to retain a small, repository-verifiable manifest/build receipt
instead of adding roughly six hundred eighty MiB of unsigned local debug outputs
that have not qualified an independent executor. This saves repository storage;
it does not make the missing bytes verified or waive final-package acceptance.
Providing a retained exact package with accessible immutable artifact storage
would close availability; a later rebuild alone cannot prove historical identity.

The repository rule is [`acct-fitness-76/.gitignore`](../acct-fitness-76/.gitignore),
whose first line is `/package/`; the
[engineering record](../acct-fitness-76/engineering.md) identifies the staged
copies as local debug artifacts rather than a signed distribution. This is
build-output exclusion policy, with a substantial storage cost, not evidence of
a licence prohibition. Git ignore rules can technically be overridden; neither
the brief nor the retained record establishes that all three files *cannot* be
committed.

| Binary | Manifest bytes | MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| codex | 607,785,336 | 579.629 |
| codex-code-mode-host | 93,937,576 | 89.586 |
| rmcp_test_server | 11,508,704 | 10.976 |
| Total | 713,231,616 | 680.191 |

These figures come from the retained
[package manifest](../acct-fitness-76/package-manifest.json); they describe
uncompressed staged files. The clean integration checkout has none of those
bytes. Thus their sizes, SHA-256 digests and mode `0555` cannot be re-derived
from that checkout. The manifest and build log are committed and checked.
The build recipe is retained in
[prepare_package.py](../acct-fitness-76/prepare_package.py), but a future rebuild
is not proof of byte-identical reproduction of the historical package.
No binaries were launched or added by this revision.
