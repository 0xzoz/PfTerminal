# PF-60-S05: default billing basis for every built-in provider

*2026-10-08. The provider list is from `built_in_model_providers` (`codex-rs/model-provider-info/src/lib.rs`) on main
`7a11f9068b`: 21 providers. Sources were read on 2026-10-08.*

Each default is the basis that matches the configuration a user is expected to have for that provider: the built-in
URL and the credential the built-in entry asks for. "Also bills" lists cases where the same vendor can charge the other
way. Those cases fall under the open "both" decision ([options memo](both-behaviour-options.md)), not under these
defaults.

## Notes

- Free starter credit (Meta, Baseten, Vercel's free tier) doesn't change the basis. It is still money on a pay-per-use
  balance, so it is counted as spent. Reconciling free credit is out of scope.
- Third-party guides describe the Z.AI and Kimi splits the same way as the sources above. Only official vendor pages are
  cited here.
- Option B (decided 2026-10-09): the basis follows the route and credential actually used. A provider reached at a
  route or with a credential this table doesn't list is "billing basis not declared", with a next step naming
  `model_providers.<id>.billing`; it is never guessed.

## Additional routes (option B)

These routes are not a built-in provider's default but are declared so a custom provider pointing at them gets the
right basis without setup. Each was read on 2026-10-09.

| Route | Credential | Basis | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4` | Z.AI API key | subscription (GLM Coding Plan) | [Z.AI: other tools](https://docs.z.ai/scenario-example/develop-tools/others): the Coding Plan uses this endpoint "instead of the General API" |
| `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/coding/paas/v4` | BigModel API key | subscription (GLM Coding Plan) | [ZCode: connect models](https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/configuration) |
| `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` | BigModel API key | pay per use | Same page: resource packages and prepaid balance use the general URL |
| `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1` | Kimi Open Platform key | pay per use | [Kimi API overview](https://platform.kimi.ai/docs/api/overview); the membership and the platform are separate products (troubleshooting page above) |
| `https://api.openai.com/v1` | OpenAI API key | pay per use | [Codex pricing](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing) |
| `https://api.openai.com/v1` | ChatGPT sign-in | subscription | [Codex pricing](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing), re-checked 2026-10-09: Codex usage with a ChatGPT sign-in is part of the plan. Codex's realtime calls send this sign-in to this host. The page doesn't name realtime separately, so a real check is listed for Travis |

Two rules apply on top of the table:

- **Local is declared only on this machine.** `ollama` and `lmstudio` are local at `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`. Pointed at any other host they are "not declared", because a remote host may be a paid service. An explicit `billing = "local"` in config still applies.
- **A user's `billing` applies to new requests only.** Every request is recorded with the basis in force when it was sent and where it came from (built-in table or config). Changing `billing` never re-prices history.
