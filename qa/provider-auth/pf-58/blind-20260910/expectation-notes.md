# Scope and unresolved expectations (after proposal freeze)

The original 26 cases and all questions remain unchanged. This record does not
waive a case or claim product-authority acceptance of an exclusion.

Existing user intent supplies these answers: provider selection and credential
health must be distinguishable; the affected credential should offer `r` recovery;
Claude subscription and Anthropic API credentials are independent; no silent
billing/provider fallback is authorized. The user explicitly wants ordinary
startup without repeated completed native consent. No native consent is bypassed.

The supported-provider inventory, exhaustive model/effort combinations, minimum
terminal size, supported migration span, and timeout/healthy-status semantics
need a bounded qualification contract. We have not invented those answers.
In particular, a stored key labeled “configured” has not proved authentication:
the new invalid-key probe demonstrates that distinction, not a live server
accepting an invalid key. F08 is unresolved against the designer's stronger
expectation; deciding whether to validate on save or explicitly label unverified
credentials is a product/UX decision, not silently assumed by this QA pass.

The independent evidence check also identified concrete Linux UI omissions:
the generic authentication warning does not name the affected provider, and
chat status for identical custom model slugs does not identify the provider.
These are recorded as failed expectations, not just missing tests. Environment
credential guidance explicitly requires a launching-shell change and restart;
that observed limit needs an explicit exception to the blanket same-session
intent, not a claim that this recovery already works without restarting.

Synthetic endpoint success is useful regression evidence but does not certify
live OpenAI/Claude/Anthropic onboarding, browser handoff, every supported
provider, billing route, or macOS consent. The original cases combine several
conditions; partial assertions do not make the whole case pass. Platform records
retain all original IDs and enumerate missing variants in each summary. F20 is
macOS-only as written; the Linux record carries it as a blocked cross-platform
handoff prerequisite rather than fabricating an approved scope exclusion.

This packet covers PF-58 provider/auth/model UX. It does not newly qualify every
security/memory feature in the wider humanTest.html; their existing prerequisites
remain visible. The case numbers PF58-Fxx are not the human checklist's 26 IDs.
