# PF-58 review scope — 2026-09-08

Original request: identify the credential rejected by codex_apps and generalize
provider-specific reauthentication, then supply a replacement human-test build.
Branch: feat/provider-reauth-health. Combined base: 472b8fed5 (includes main
3cec54d99 / 0.1.41 and the previously qualified security integration).
Review only the local PF-58 patch, not inherited security/release history.

Boundary: typed HTTP401 startup attribution, session-local credential health,
source-appropriate /providers recovery and existing auth adapters. Preserve
activation, current model and billing context. No live credentials in tests.
No automatic account/source fallback. Generic403/429/network errors are not
credential rejection. Cancellation must retain the failure. Successful replacement
must permit another request/reconnect without restart. External sources receive
instructions rather than a managed credential override.

Review budget: Astra High and Fable5.1 High via Corbanu/TMUX; five total maximum.
Four reviews completed (two Astra High and two Fable5.1 High). This is review
five, the final integration review. Focused final TMUX tests are running; do not
infer a pass. Astra's second review was clean. Fable's second found the
host-recreation ledger gap, now fixed by reusing the model policy host when the
temporary setup handle is absent. A real-TMUX account-success path also found
the old auth modal covering the updated manager. Correlated completion now
dismisses only the named shared account-auth view in management and setup.
Review these final fixes and their regression tests, plus the complete patch.
Review the complete current PF-58 diff against HEAD, including subsequent
protocol 401 classification, environment ownership, repeated-rejection guard,
narrow snapshot, and the corrected synthetic account/key fixtures. The inventory
below is the original freeze, not an instruction to omit these bounded additions.
The account fixture uses built-in `openai_base_url`/`chatgpt_base_url` controls;
reserved-provider and trusted-MCP-origin guards remain intact. The harness menu
parser must distinguish submitted prompts from the active selection.
The live user's new candidate has shown OpenAI "Credential needs attention",
Claude configured/current, and the `r` -> "Sign in to OpenAI again" menu.
No live sign-in has been attempted on the user's behalf.

Known broader failure outside this patch: the inherited native-child convergence
case fails with "source admission policy is unavailable" after combining main
and the security integration. This is a disclosed candidate limitation, not a
passing release gate. Do not expand PF-58 into a source-admission redesign.
Non-test Rust changed lines: 568. This exceeds the small-change guideline;
reviewable stages are (1) typed transport/health contract, (2) TUI adapters and
recovery, (3) regression proof. None is independently advertised as a finished
feature; qualification applies to the combined candidate.

Latest-main integration preserved both plan histories. The sprint checker also
reports upstream duplicate PF-43/44/45 IDs and absent feature/backlinks, plus an
inherited PF20/PF43 order collision. Those are not resolved by PF-58. Its own
execution order has been moved from 17 to 22 to avoid the new PF57-S02 collision.
