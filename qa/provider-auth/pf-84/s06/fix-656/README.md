# #656: flag-off resume of a named-account conversation

tmux, disposable home, `CORBANU_TEST_NO_NATIVE_KEYRING=1`, local mock Responses server, fake API keys only.
A conversation is recorded with `corbanu exec --account work` (named OpenAI API-key account), then
`corbanu resume <id> --disable named_accounts` runs in a tmux pane (script: `t656.sh`).

## BEFORE: installed dev build from main
```
== before: $ corbanu resume <id> --disable named_accounts
