# The Aggressive security level: demo reel

One narrated video of the Aggressive security level as it stands after the fixes of 2026-10-13. It extends the
[P0 security reel](P0-security-reel.md) (the building blocks, 2026-10-08) with what a person who chooses Aggressive
gets, edited from the issue demo videos indexed in this folder (`issue-6*.md`, `ISSUE-*.md`, `AGG-*.md`). It is an
asset on the [`demos` prerelease](https://github.com/CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal/releases/tag/demos).

- Video: [aggressive-reel-2026-10-13.mp4](https://github.com/CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal/releases/download/demos/aggressive-reel-2026-10-13.mp4) (9:58, 1920x1080, 30 fps, H.264/AAC, chapters
  embedded) · subtitles: [aggressive-reel-2026-10-13.srt](https://github.com/CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal/releases/download/demos/aggressive-reel-2026-10-13.srt)
- Security levels are behind the default-off `security_levels` flag.
- The third code-blind milestone run ([record](../../security-levels/milestones/aggressive-20261013-third/README.md), PR #741) is **not passed**: 51 passed, 6 failed, 7 blocked of 64 (defects #736, #737, #739; advisory #740). Aggressive is **not signed off**: the record requests Travis's named sign-off, and none is recorded. Chapter 11 and the summary say so.
- Every terminal frame is a published demo recording (GLM 5.3 Flash on Z.AI, recorded 2026-10-10 to 2026-10-13; each
  clip's commit is in its panel). Clips are trimmed to the moment that proves the criterion; waiting is sped up (an
  on-screen badge shows the rate) and proof frames are held. Added on top: chapter cards, an evidence card for the
  milestone runs, a side panel naming the sprint or issue and the criterion, highlights on the proving lines, and
  burned-in subtitles.
- Criteria come from the owner decisions recorded on the issues (#442, #620, #623, #626, #507, #660) and the P0
  sprint records; the decisions are listed in the milestone runs' amendment tables.
- Narration: Breeze TTS, synthetic voice `corbanu-narrator-calm-v1` (the earlier reels' voice, portable voice
  library).
