# owner-handoff-80 — live promotion commands (NOT EXECUTED)

Round 93 preparation correction: use the explicit frozen-input bridge below
before selecting actions. This recipe does not repair already-prepared actions
in place. Receipt of the source change alone does not make flat actions runnable.

Round 94 adds the mandatory [runnable preflight](owner-promotion-94-preflight.md).
It evaluates prerequisites 1–5 before disarm, uninstall or source replacement.
Any publication `*.pending` refuses as `stale_publication_pending`; quiesce
publishers, preserve and inspect the pending artifact and last publication, then
reconcile the interrupted write under integration-owner authority. Never delete
evidence or blindly retry. The prior failed attempt remains in the
[assertion audit](owner-shape-93-assertion-audit.md).
No live promotion or real-worker qualification is claimed.

This recipe changes the existing installation in place, preserving owner history,
coordinator history, activation generations, schedule ticks and recovery evidence.
Run it only after receiving this candidate and coordinating with the hand
dispatcher. This worker did not inspect or access the live installation.

Round 85 correction: the concurrent rehearsal proves real tmux/PTY and journal
coordination with synthetic workers. It does **not** qualify real Corbanu rollout
provenance, auth-link startup, model latency, ACK/START/RETURN or RETURN after pane
death under two dispatchers. Those remain a separate real-binary, disposable-root
qualification, or explicitly limited evidence from the first authorized promoted
action. Do not call this recipe a fully qualified real-worker promotion.

The deliberate watchdog policy is ownership-local: scheduled owner passes cover
owner-owned actions; the manager must arrange stall detection for hand-owned
actions, including every future default action. Manual `--hand-run` reports their
stalls when admitted, but there is no scheduled hand watchdog. Disarm disables
both lanes. This preserves the accepted hand ownership boundary and avoids
mutating hand claims from the owner lane.

Read the computed `coordinator.watchdog_coverage.summary` before executing the
cutover using the received candidate's status reader. Round 89 corrects counts:
only unreported overdue dispatching/dispatched/running actions count. Prepared,
returned, uncertain, terminal, already-reported and future-deadline actions do
not. The separate ownership map includes those actions.

The exact line formats are below; `C` and `E` stand for observed integer counts,
not literal text to type or invented live measurements:

```text
BEFORE: Owner watchdog on admitted ticks (unreported overdue actions): covered=C, excluded=0; manager=covered; new default actions=covered; hand stall detection=covered by this watchdog.
AFTER: Owner watchdog on admitted ticks (unreported overdue actions): covered=C, excluded=E; manager=covered; new default actions=excluded; hand stall detection=manager responsibility (--hand-run is manual; no scheduled hand watchdog).
```

BEFORE ARM uses the AFTER format with its own observed counts. The recipe prints
all three computed lines and checks the same-snapshot counts against report
predictions. Manager coverage and hand guidance come from the watchdog's own
lane predicate. The expected change is fixture-wide coverage to owner-lane
coverage; count equality across time is not expected. Existing actions can
expire, report or finish between reads. Predictions require an admitted tick
reaching its watchdog; status alone does not prove admission or service health.

If the fields, line or action predictions disagree within a snapshot, or the
routing change differs from these expectations, stop the cutover. Before arm,
leave admission OFF; after arm, revoke admission with the current generation
using the disarm command below. Keep both raw status JSONs, timestamps, revisions,
pins and the refusal transcript. Quiesce cooperating dispatchers and compare
each changed action's status, deadline, stall flag and owner; re-read with the
received candidate before proceeding. Do not edit SQLite, retry arming blindly,
or assume disarm kills existing workers. If ownership, holds or pins remain
uncertain, escalate to the integration owner with that evidence.

Before the command, stop **new hand dispatch and raw key delivery** and let any
in-progress delivery finish. Leave existing workers running. Finish/reconcile
any outstanding manager cycle. Both sides must use the **same existing
coordinator directory**, with its existing resource reservations. Do not seed or
clone a second coordinator for the same worktrees.

Prepare a private (0600), reviewed transport JSON using the already-supported
transport schema. Its values are installation inputs, not values this worker can
discover without violating the no-live-access instruction:

```json
{
  "kind": "tmux",
  "binary": "/absolute/path/to/reviewed/CorbanuTerminal",
  "binary_sha256": "SHA256_OF_THAT_BINARY",
  "tmux": "/absolute/path/to/tmux",
  "runs_dir": "/private/0700/short/worker-runs",
  "auth_link": "/absolute/path/to/operator-approved/auth.json"
}
```

The transport only creates the existing auth link; this recipe never reads,
prints or hashes auth contents. The short runs path must leave each generated
tmux socket path below 100 bytes. Preserve each selected allocation's exact
model/provider/effort/worktree and recorded `--yolo` policy. Do not substitute
the rehearsal's synthetic worker.

Before registering each worker allocation, the manager's preparation code must
call the received candidate's named bridge. Supply provider and policy from the
actual allocation authority, never from a model-name guess or the active profile:

```python
from owner_tmux import freeze_worker_inputs
# cycle_inputs is the exact original eight-field action input object.
bound = freeze_worker_inputs(cycle_inputs, provider=authorized_provider,
                            policy=authorized_policy)  # must explicitly be "--yolo"
allocation_id = bound.pop("allocation")
allocation["inputs"] = bound
coordinator.put_allocation(allocation_id, allocation, replace=replace_existing,
                           expected_revision=coordinator.snapshot()["revision"],
                           evidence=actual_preparation_authority)
# The next accepted manager decision must copy the registered inputs exactly:
action_inputs = {"allocation": allocation_id, **allocation["inputs"]}
```

Keep the brief SHA, base, task and other cycle values unchanged. The worker block
is included in the allocation digest and exact accepted action inputs. Replacing
a registered allocation cancels its old prepared actions and is refused while
it has active reservations. Finish/reconcile active work first, then replace
using the owner API and accept a fresh manager decision with a NEW action ID.
Do not patch an action's inputs or reuse its old digest/claim. Future cycles need
this bridge too; this worker cannot modify the external manager's preparation
code. Already-frozen nested worker inputs remain supported, but duplicated flat
model/reasoning_effort/worktree/provider/policy must agree. The flat field is
`reasoning_effort`; the nested field is `worker.effort`.

The following are exact commands; replace the seven operator inputs with the
actual reviewed transport path, prepared action IDs and real activation
decision. Their values cannot be honestly invented by this worker.

```bash
export OWNER94_PREFLIGHT=/absolute/path/to/reviewed-promotion-preflight.json

```

A busy command, stale revision, unresolved operation, drift, active owner claim
or wrong state is a refusal to inspect, not a reason to edit SQLite. If a step
fails after disarm, retain its output; admission stays OFF until the explicit
arm step. The initial installation kickstart's OFF hold is cleared only by the
last explicit recovery command. A post-arm failure may leave admission armed:
use the disarm command below to revoke it. This recipe is a promotion procedure,
not an automatic retry/recovery utility.

## First five minutes

Read the printed exact `python`, `runtime` and `config` paths into shell variables
`OWNER80_PYTHON`, `OWNER80_RUNTIME`, `OWNER80_CONFIG`, then run:

```bash
"$OWNER80_PYTHON" -E -s -S -B "$OWNER80_RUNTIME/owner_daemon.py" \
  --activation-status --config "$OWNER80_CONFIG"
"$OWNER80_PYTHON" -E -s -S -B "$OWNER80_RUNTIME/owner_daemon.py" \
  --observe --schedule "$OWNER80_SCHEDULE"
```

At the cutover, inspect `coordinator.dispatch_control.revision/at` and every
`coordinator.ownership` row: selected prepared work is owner-owned; existing
hand claims keep their exact claim and allocation digest. Unassigned future
actions default to hand. Since round 6 of `owner-manager-enabled-20261002.md`, an armed
owner tick routes unassigned, prepared, unclaimed, gate-admissible worker actions from a
manager run in a configured worktree to owner (audited handoff, `armed_scope_default_route`);
everything else stays hand. Both hand and daemon command paths use this same config.
Inspect `coordinator.watchdog_coverage.excluded_actions`: their stall detection
belongs to the manager. Check top-level `unresolved_holds`, including
`excluded_from_owner_lane`; an excluded hold remains unresolved and blocks
reconfiguration. Moving ownership or running schedule `--recover` does not
resolve it. Resolve a hold only with `owner_daemon.py --resolve-hold <request.json>
--config "$OWNER80_CONFIG"` after stopping the worker on its own recorded socket
(round 5, `owner-manager-enabled-20261002.md`). It requires the exact unresolved
reasons, claim and allocation digest, fails the claim instead of resuming it, and
records `resolution_evidence_digest` and `resolved_at`. Do not edit SQLite to
manufacture resolution or describe disarm as a complete scope rollback.

During minutes 0–1, expect the first interval tick, a new owner boot and selected
actions moving prepared → dispatching. During minutes 1–3, check actual ACK,
START and working evidence in the private worker rollout/journal. Pane text or
sent keys alone do not establish ACK or working. Every action should have one
claim, one prepare, one launch, one prompt and one START; pending ACK/readiness
is not a successful worker execution.

During minutes 3–5, require continued interval successes and forward progress
or a specific truthful failure. Returned work remains unaccepted until the
existing manager verifies it. Hand claims must keep their state except for
their own dispatcher activity. `BUSY` is an explicit skipped pass, not an
admitted success; repeated BUSY or stale last-success is contention to resolve.
Watch for `prior_activation`, `effect_uncertain`, `lease_expired`,
`missing_ack`, runtime/credential prompts, or wrong ownership. A recurring
dashboard mark alone does not prove worker supervision.

A cooperating manual TMUX pass uses:

```bash
"$OWNER80_PYTHON" -E -s -S -B "$OWNER80_RUNTIME/owner_daemon.py" \
  --hand-run --config "$OWNER80_CONFIG"
```

It only operates hand-owned claims with the shared journal. Legacy claims
without that journal are reported `external_hand_claim`; their existing hand
dispatcher remains responsible for them. Do not send raw keys into daemon
panes or run another coordinator against overlapping work. These fences govern
cooperating tools, not a hostile process with the same OS account.

For subsequent transfer, write a private JSON request with the current
coordinator revision and each selected action's exact `from/to/claim/status/
allocation_digest`, then use the same command in either direction:

```bash
"$OWNER80_PYTHON" -E -s -S -B "$OWNER80_RUNTIME/owner_daemon.py" \
  --handoff /absolute/path/to/frozen-transfer.json --config "$OWNER80_CONFIG"
```

The successful SQLite commit is the transfer instant; its revision/time and
evidence are returned and audited. An active journal-backed claim preserves its
claim ID and completed deliveries. Legacy hand claims cannot be silently
adopted: finish or reconcile them through the existing protocol and hand over
new prepared work.

To revoke admission, use the generation from the latest activation-status:

```bash
"$OWNER80_PYTHON" -E -s -S -B "$OWNER80_RUNTIME/owner_daemon.py" \
  --disarm --config "$OWNER80_CONFIG" --generation CURRENT_GENERATION
```

Disarm revokes both shared transport dispatchers; it does not terminate workers.
Retain raw evidence and let the existing owner reconciliation handle them.
