# PF80 fresh Fable launcher candidate

Classification: product initiative, PF-80-S01 **in_progress**, under
`docs/plans/active/initiative-delivery-control.md`. Product citation:
**Internal delivery control — TO BUILD**, “fresh Fable 5.1 High management through
Corbanu/TMUX” and “Use sequential sprints per initiative”. The exact mandate is
`docs/research/tasknode-integration/coordinator-bootstrap-20260913.md`.

Implementation checkout: `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/fable-launcher-20260913`,
branch `bootstrap/fable-launcher-20260913`, starting HEAD
`1c0df3cb8517b4b578c421ca59ba215f48c7d8c3` as explicitly assigned. The allocation's
older `eb01bf006...` base is historical. Parent owns shared plan/sprint updates.
Only this receipt and `scripts/initiative_control/{fable_launcher,test_fable_launcher}.py`
are owned. No coordinator/integration changes, agent/review invocation, deployment,
real credential inspection or live inference was performed by this worker.

## Coordinator interface

```text
python3 scripts/initiative_control/fable_launcher.py \
  --briefing /absolute/redacted-briefing.json \
  --runs-dir /absolute/private-short-directory \
  --binary /absolute/corbanu --auth-file /absolute/private-auth.json \
  --timeout 300
```

`--runs-dir` must already be an owner-only directory (0700), without symlink
components. Each invocation creates a unique child; existing runs are untouched.
Use a short path: the resulting `<runs-dir>/f-XXXXXXXX/tmux.sock` must be under
100 bytes for macOS Unix sockets. No shared application home is accepted.
Briefing is one JSON object, at most 64 KiB, already redacted by the coordinator.
Timeout is 1–3600 seconds (default 300) for the interactive phase; allow preflight
and bounded shutdown overhead when supervising the CLI. SIGINT/SIGTERM request
cleanup; do not SIGKILL the sidecar during that cleanup window.

The outer owner provisions `--auth-file` as JSON with exactly one string field,
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. The file must be owner-only (0600 or stricter), owned
by the caller, regular, single-linked, with no symlink path components. It is
read as data, never sourced. No actual token example is stored here. The child
rechecks the file and its private digest before injecting the value into only
Corbanu's environment. Auth values are absent from command arguments, briefing,
launcher script, manifest and stdout. The file is neither copied nor deleted.
The environment also serves the existing CLI resolver. The TUI additionally
requires explicit native managed-source selection, now performed below before
the first brief. The launcher invokes no setup-token or new-login command.

Stdout is one JSON receipt. Successful exit 0 means `status="completed"`,
`decision` is the parsed **entire** final JSON object, and `run_id`, `session_id`,
`model="claude-opus-5-plan"` (Opus 5.0 High; `claude-fable-5-1-plan` before the 2026-09-14 directive), `provider="claude-plan"`, `effort="high"` are present.
`thread_id`, `turn_id`, `response_id`, timestamps, exact private socket/session,
artifact paths and verified `shutdown` accompany them. `session_id` comes from
session metadata, not the TMUX name or a fabricated UUID.

Exit 1 returns `status="failed"` or `"timeout"`, `decision=null`, and a fixed
redacted `error` code. Cancellation is `failed`/`cancelled`. Unclean or unverifiable
shutdown fails the run even if a candidate answer exists. The receipt is retained
in its private run directory; invalid arguments/root paths may fail before that
directory can exist. A filesystem write failure is reported as failure, never
success. Syntax errors use argparse's conventional exit 2 without a run.
Parent must require exit 0, completed, clean shutdown and the exact tuple before
its own decision validation/acceptance. Artifact paths are private, not export URLs.

## Evidence and boundaries

The launcher uses interactive Corbanu in actual TMUX, no exec/resume/fork/last.
It clears inherited environment, assigns fresh HOME/Corbanu/Codex/Claude/XDG/temp
directories, disables project instructions, skills, hooks, shell, agents, apps,
plugins and web/browser capabilities through supported configuration, pins project
discovery to CWD (`project_root_markers=[]`) with a private Git ceiling, and sets
read-only sandbox/never approval. The entire bounded briefing is sent literally;
text and Enter use separate commands. `RUST_LOG=trace` and private log_dir follow
the required TUI skill. No broad permission flag is supplied.

Acceptance requires one fresh CLI session, no inherited history/parent, exact
turn model/provider/high effort and read-only permissions, a correlated provider
response identity, and a matching terminal task_complete/turn_complete event with
the full JSON answer and no terminal error/truncation. Pane quietness, tool outputs,
partial JSONL writes and JSON snippets are never completion evidence. Tool calls
and additional turns fail the attempt. The final records are rechecked after
shutdown. The launcher validates action framing; allowed kinds, authority, scope,
dependencies and expected/state revisions remain exclusively parent decisions.

Private evidence includes binary version/hash, source/launch/briefing hashes,
briefing manifest, readiness/final pane captures, complete final answer, input
hash/key journal, original session records and durable receipt. A candidate is
recorded before exit but only the final receipt is dispatchable. Known injected
secrets and recognizable token patterns are rejected/redacted on output, including
decoded JSON strings. This is not a general classifier for arbitrary private data.
Raw native trace/session files are private evidence and require owner inspection
and redaction before any export; the launcher does not publish them.

A pre-exec gate records PID/group/start identity before starting Corbanu. Cleanup
tries Escape, clear input and `/exit`, waits, then signals only observed owned
process identities, removes only this session and verifies process/session exit.
Failures retain artifacts. No global TMUX kill-server or process-name kill exists.
Fresh context/read-only configuration is **not** complete filesystem/tool/network
containment or a qualified code-blind functional executor; SIGKILL/host loss and
adversarial escaped descendants require an external supervisor/isolation owner.

## Offline verification and remaining acceptance

Exact suite: `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/initiative_control -p test_fable_launcher.py -v`.
Original candidate final run: **27 passed, 0 skipped, 23.032s**. Tests use synthetic
tokens/records and actual private TMUX sessions with an offline fake terminal.
The real reference binary is used only for `--help` and `--version` in fresh
empty homes. Tests skip explicitly if TMUX/reference binary is absent.

Preserved attempts: initial 24 tests / 18.001s: 23 passed, one forced-cleanup
fixture failed because Escape remained in canonical terminal input. Added C-u
before `/exit`; corrected 24 tests / 20.127s passed. Subsequent hardening adds
canonical permission checks, escaped-token rejection, credential-rotation and
late-final-record regressions: 25 tests / 20.278s and 27 tests / 23.419s passed;
these results do not erase the first attempt. Final project-root isolation pass
passed all 27 tests in 23.032s. `python3 docs/plans/check.py` passes (3/3 active),
`python3 docs/sprints/check.py` passes (115 current / 126 archived), and scoped
Git whitespace validation passes. Original allocation: 1,168 lines (599 launcher,
445 tests, 124 this evidence record), below the 1,200 target / 1,500 hard limit.

Parent still owns two actual independent Fable runs, live identity/config/auth
compatibility, full decisions, timeout/cancel shutdown qualification, material
review and combined coordinator tests. This internal engineering increment uses
the allocation's reasoned internal-only GUI N/A; later combined dashboard/Slack
acceptance still requires independent code-blind design/execution/evidence.
No TensorCash/Isometric runtime or release/benchmark acceptance is claimed; no
human sign-off, recurring enablement or sprint completion is claimed.

## September 13 correction worker

Starting HEAD `627dd1f0841ac76384687de4844d6bbe0a8b9f6e`, same branch and three
files. Review01 (review text only) found unanchored SECRET matching ordinary
task/risk/bearer vocabulary and serialized-receipt redaction risking invalid JSON.
Exact injected-token replacement remains primary; recognizable token patterns now
have boundaries and minimum lengths. Receipt redaction walks decoded strings
before encoding. Regressions retain normal vocabulary, trailing `bearer `, JSON
quoting and escaped-secret rejection, including a complete TMUX decision round trip.

Parent's installed 0.1.41 attempts01/02 timed out at120/90s, with clean owned
shutdown; these remain failures. Parent reports successful manual diagnostic03
after supported setup/resubmit: session `01a0995a-da26-7d23-b340-241ccabd8883`,
turn `01a0995c-e64b-7520-8da6-7b000d57a252`, response `msg_011Cezw2VfcGxJA1ptUWPjBk`,
run `f-6lvdp9vl`, exact model/provider/high, three complete wait actions and
unforced shutdown. This is parent-reported diagnostic evidence, not automated
qualification. No private parent auth, logs or state were accessed.

Startup now waits for the loaded exact model/high header, opens `/providers`,
asserts initial OpenAI selection, moves Down to Claude Account, presses `r`,
asserts Recover Claude Account / selected Claude credential, enters the method
picker, asserts recommended long-lived token selection, and enters the masked
form. Only then does stdin feed a private named TMUX buffer; paste uses `-d`,
finally deletes the buffer, and Enter is separate. No token or token hash enters
the text/key journal. Native UI owns managed credential persistence; the launcher
never synthesizes vault files. Claude Account must become Enabled/configured/current
before Escape and the first brief. Current-screen captures exclude scrollback;
unexpected stages time out, definite auth/inactive failures fail promptly.
`auth-00` through `auth-07` pane files and numeric journal stages provide redacted
setup evidence; failures retain `failure-pane.txt` and its receipt path. Runtime
turn metadata remains authoritative, with no provider fallback or resubmission.

All original27 test methods and prior failed-fixture history remain. First
correction run:31 tests/53.064s,30 passed; forced-cleanup fixture failed because
its Escape parser consumed Ctrl-U as an arrow. Corrected parser:31/56.652s pass.
Final transport/failure additions verify actual TMUX stdin-only tokens, no token
in arguments/artifacts, rejected/noncurrent providers, stale panes and interruption
after both buffer load and paste. Final source/tests: **31 passed, 0 skipped,
65.584s**. Plan checker passes3/3; sprint checker passes115 current/126 archived;
scoped whitespace check passes. Final allocation:1,451 lines (691 launcher,
592 tests,168 receipt), within1,500. No Rust/provider contract changes.
Parent owns material review, corrected live runs and combined coordinator checks.

Parent continuation after worker closure: review02 found an in-scope false-failure
on a transient Checking provider row after one second, plus rejection-message
drift against the actual Rust strings. Both are corrected in these same files;
Checking now receives the original ten-second stage budget, while definitive
noncurrent rows and actual rejected/not-saved messages still fail. No new scope.
Integrator authorizes one changed-candidate review03, preserving the seven prior
bootstrap review uses. Before this correction, two unattended real runs completed
with distinct sessions and unforced clean shutdown; all31 offline tests passed.
Those results remain historical; final changed-candidate runs are required.

Final correction:32 offline tests passed in66.561s, zero skips. Review03 verifies
both production fixes; its only P3 is pure Checking-test placement in the
TMUX-required test class. Integrator records this as a nonblocking portability
follow-up: supported launcher qualification requires TMUX and this run executed
the test. No runtime defect or missing supported-host test remains; review03
exit1 is retained, not relabeled as a clean exit0. No extra unchanged-code review.
Two automatic final-tree runs completed with exact model/provider/high and clean
unforced shutdown: `f-6kapzpp9`, session01a09974-2a90-7a82-bbb4-db1194e596b9;
`f-684we1b3`, session01a09976-84ac-77a2-851c-6a5aa46536e7. Both capture all three
wait decisions, not real work dispatch. Private receipts under
`/private/tmp/cfable.msxBbt` retain native evidence; never publish the whole root.
Parent accepts this internal launcher checkpoint, not overall management launch.
