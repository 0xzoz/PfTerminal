# Task Node task map: PF-80 work breakdown

This file links each Task Node task to the commits, QA records and PF-80-S01
ledger entries that make up its real work. Use it to check any evidence sent
against these tasks.

- Decision: `tasknode-writeback-20261002`, A1 (Travis, 2026-10-03): the closed
  workstream 3 task gets no further submissions; new tasks cover the actual
  breakdown and are mapped back to the work here.
- Account: GitHub `IridiumMaster` / `@iridiumeagle`, account
  `acct_oauth_73e1ab2f9f7cd01d3ee6230e`, `~/.corbanu` default profile.
- Created: 2026-10-03, one `tasknode request create --body-file` per task,
  source title "Corbanu PF-80 breakdown 2026-10-03". Each request was sent once.
  Task Node generated the tasks itself.
- Task state at 2026-10-03T09:58Z: all five **Proposed**. Travis accepted all
  five (2026-10-03, "I have accepted the tasks"); at 10:32Z each read
  **Accepted** with `canSubmitInitialEvidence` true. Corbanu did not accept,
  refuse or move any of them.
- 2026-10-03 10:52Z: all five read **Rewarded** (16.3 PFT total: 3a 2.5, 3b 2.8,
  3c 4, 3d 4, 3e 3).
- Round 3, 2026-10-03 10:45–10:47Z: initial evidence was submitted once for each
  of the five tasks, and each then read **Verification requested**. Receipts and
  verification responses are in the
  [writeback record](tasknode-writeback-live-20261002.md), round 3.
- Ledger references are the opening words of each bullet in
  [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md).
  Line numbers change when the ledger is edited, so they are not used.

## Closed parent

| Task | State | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task_789a0f3bd75b41d1eca20cae698f04cf`, Corbanu workstream 3: Task Node integration and beta-test coordination | Rewarded 2026-09-15 (final) | Historical only. Nothing more is submitted against it (A1). `PF-80-S01` was repointed to `task_80628c7…` on 2026-10-03 (round 3). `PF-79-S01/S02` still point here; PF-79 beta work is paused. |

## Network task (not PF-80)

### `task_f4bec7ef5c4454dacbe0f7494ed35f16`: Find and Fix One Reproducible Bug in PostfiatL1V2

- Reward shown: 100. Travis accepted it 2026-10-03 (Accepted at 10:32Z).

  limit (scan and index paths, `crates/node/src/block_finality.rs`).
- PR: https://github.com/postfiatorg/postfiatl1v2/pull/55 (IridiumMaster fork,
  branch `fix/account-tx-exact-limit-truncation`, commit `b7a54b95`, base

  regression test), merge commit `b1d1928c091ed66836ce69d49cf8bc192a969281`.

## Personal tasks (not PF-80)

### `task_05099d2ec350b875c3b6b638571a22ca`: Draft the AI newsletter section covering NeoClouds, SpaceX/XAI, and AI Capex

- Request: `req_f9052fb2-f908-40de-88e2-4714ca863561`. Reward shown: 2.5. Accepted
  2026-08-13 (`evt_0fbc65d1fccc1be80982df0a`). Corbanu did not accept it, move it
  or claim the reward.
- Work: the AI section for the newsletter Travis writes with Alex, "AI: Everybody
  Wants to Be the Landlord". It covers AI capex, NeoClouds and SpaceX/xAI, with data
  current to 2026-10-05, 26 dated sources and a HyperLiquid/Binance angle. An
  independent agent reviewed it: the first pass failed, the issues were fixed, and the
  re-review passed. Alex has not reviewed it yet, and it is not published.
- Deliverable: `.codex-work/workers-20261005/ai-newsletter-section-20261005.md`,
  sha256 `8b8ac8a1f08f884f8f68890db8f8a0c36bb61f8bc2e88fdb617c19c1b1026b83`.
- Evidence: one initial submission on 2026-10-06 ~00:46Z (full section text), receipt
  `task_evt_eabb4ab0-56e9-4800-b0c1-6fbddde18e7a`. Task Node then asked for the
  file's sha256. One verification response was sent, receipt
  `task_evt_1f2d6d31-3472-4492-90d8-4395f142d4c1`, and the task read **Rewarded**
  (2.5 PFT) at 2026-10-06T00:47:11Z. The CLI creates its own idempotency key, so the
  local guard key, bodies and receipts are in
  `.codex-work/workers-20261005/tasknode-05099d2/`.

### `task_96e88f7099fd906d9b8080775ab6c402`: Draft the private inference user flow spec for PF Terminal

- Request: `req_e7e9d13a-7aaa-48fd-9be8-741f6346b065`. Reward shown: 2.5.

- Work: `docs/specs/private-inference-user-flow.md` (draft proposal, not a shipped
  feature), PR https://github.com/CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal/pull/170 (branch
  `docs/private-inference-user-flow-spec`, base `6bd7fe8413`). Commits
  `059685a57f`, `36ae77ebe7`, `f7e9fb6964` (file sha256 `b227050e…3fdc39`). Open,
  not merged.
- Review: two independent read-only reviews. Round 1 failed 2 criteria with 9
  findings. Round 2 resolved 8 and left 1 partial, raised 3 new issues, and
  rated all criteria PASS. All open items were fixed in `f7e9fb6964`.
- Evidence: submitted once on 2026-10-06 at about 00:53Z, receipt
  `task_evt_4e144110-eae5-4fa9-8683-ee884407c145`. The verification request
  asked for the tier tables and the B.3 billing example verbatim. Response
  receipt: `task_evt_d04d92f3-2be4-4603-8a4d-be08fd8efa10`. Bodies are in
  `.codex-work/workers-20261005/tasknode-96e88f7-{evidence,verification}.md`.
- Outcome: **Rewarded** 2026-10-06 00:56Z, 2.25 PFT, tx
  `6075F5DD81161E15ED333A275EC7B13642626D86B04B6B71CF9954CAD571965B`.
- Open: product decisions OD1–OD4 and dependencies D1–D3 listed in the spec.

## Rules for evidence against these tasks

1. Submit evidence only after Task Node shows the task as accepted and
   `actions.canSubmitInitialEvidence` is true. Corbanu never accepts tasks itself.
2. Cite only the commits and records listed for that task, plus anything added to
   this file later with its own commit.
3. A Campaign Tracker progress event cites a task ID through the `control.json`
   mapping. Repoint `PF-80-S01` from the Rewarded parent to the accepted task first.
