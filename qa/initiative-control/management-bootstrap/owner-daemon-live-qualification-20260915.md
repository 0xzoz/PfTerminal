# Owner daemon live qualification — September 15, 2026

## Outcome

**Unattended startup is not qualified.** The unmodified daemon launched the pinned
real Corbanu worker, but its fresh profile stopped at an update dialog and then a
directory-trust prompt. No ACK or START occurred in that lane. A separate,
explicitly provisioned fixture completed the real model lifecycle, including
recording a durable RETURN after the worker was killed. The four requested safety
demonstrations passed within the limitations below. Recurrence remains OFF;
activation is a separate manager decision requiring notification to Travis.

This receipt is routine qualification/evidence work for the existing product
initiative, with no implementation changes. Product heading: **Internal delivery
control — TO BUILD**; excerpt: “durable event dispatch, acknowledgments and
watchdog” and “initialize and rehearse all three workstreams before enabling
recurring operation.” Plan: `docs/plans/active/initiative-delivery-control.md`
(active); sprint: PF-80-S01 (in_progress). Shared plan/sprint allocation
reconciliation remains manager-owned.

## Environment and production-target exclusion

Artifact root, abbreviated **Q** below:
`/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915`.
The executable harness is [qualify.py](/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915/qualify.py).
[commands.jsonl](/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915/commands.jsonl)
records harness invocations, subprocess commands/environment, observations,
profile provisioning, fault injection, cleanup and revisions with timestamps.

Four fresh Coordinators were initialized at `Q/{live,provisioned,expiry,uncertain}/state`.
Each has its own config, activation, three workstreams, three in-progress fixture
sprints, three frozen allocations, one implement action and two prepared wait
actions. They were not copied from production. All worktrees are freshly
initialized, empty scratch Git repositories under the corresponding fixture
folder; there is no product source/history in them. Coordinator seed revision is
4 after fixture initialization, enablement, event and validated decision.
The owner seed/decision is harness authority, not a claim of manager inference.

Every configured target is checked before setup, each tick and subsequent state
access: its resolved path must equal `Q/<case>/state`, lie under Q, and not lie
under `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/initiative-control.oGQGyA/state`.
Every recorded check says `production_targeted:false`. No production Coordinator
was constructed, queried or mutated; no production activation record was opened
or written. The SDK command includes only the preexisting **venv site-packages**
path under the similarly named parent, not its state directory. The evidence is
an auditable configuration/call trace; it is not an OS-wide access audit or an
isolation claim against a malicious same-UID worker.

Activation schema requires `scope:"tmux-workers"` for this real transport, so the
fixture limitation is explicitly stated in `authority`, fixture-specific
`decision_id`, and digest-bound config pointing only at the new Coordinator.
These records confer no production authority. Setup first created OFF state;
only disposable owner rows were armed offline. No service/timer was installed,
enabled or scheduled. Cleanup set all four disposable owner modes back to OFF,
retaining activation records as historical fixture evidence.

## Exact package and profile contract

- Binary: `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/provider-reauth-health/macos-candidate-final9-20260910/bin/corbanu`.
- Observed version: **0.1.41** in the actual TUI.
- Binary SHA-256: `4a8eba7b10199ea49aee42a720687b63cb4b1b2194c2ce164d1b9f6f88ee510e`.
- Daemon package digest: `0b88edce04aad1e7ee5de08f51367a947c106a14388909057ee2131f8d6f0e57`.
- TMUX: `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/tmux/3.7c/bin/tmux`.
- Runtime: `gpt-6-astra`, provider `openai`, effort `high`, recorded `--yolo`
  policy expressed by the transport as `--sandbox danger-full-access --ask-for-approval never`.

The daemon transport created private `Q/r/w-*/home` profiles, dedicated sockets,
160×48 PTYs and remain-on-exit sessions. HOME and all three profile aliases point
at the new private home; its restricted environment does not inherit inference
credentials. Following the explicitly assigned manager contract, the transport
created the native auth-file symlink without the harness opening, copying,
hashing or printing its contents. This is authorized linked-auth inference,
not credential-free inference or isolated synthetic-credential qualification.
No native credential prompt was observed. The worker used only the file-writing
tool on its allocated `proof.txt`; no credential inspection was requested.

**Startup mismatch:** unlike the manager's launch contract, the transport does
not suppress update checks or provision project trust. The `live` pane offered
an update from 0.1.41 to 0.1.43. The harness sent Down and then Enter, selecting
Skip, solely to inspect the next checkpoint. No update ran. The next pane asked
whether to trust the scratch directory. No trust-prompt approval was sent.
Ticks remained `awaiting_ready`.

The separate `provisioned` lane wraps only `TmuxAdapter.prepare`: it first calls
the real implementation, then writes fresh-profile config before launch:

```toml
check_for_update_on_startup = false
[tui]
animations = false
[analytics]
enabled = false
[projects."/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915/provisioned/scratch"]
trust_level = "trusted"
```

This trust applies to the harness-created empty scratch repository. It is a
fixture setup amendment, not an implementation fix. No real worker, model
response, rollout, ACK, RETURN or daemon receipt was mocked. All later ticks use
the unmodified adapter. This lane establishes lifecycle behavior after explicit
profile provisioning; it cannot qualify unattended default startup.
The exact transport also omits the test-tui skill's trace/log-dir launch settings;
raw panes, rollouts and daemon receipts are retained, but no added trace setting
or patched launcher is claimed.

## Per-tick results

All completed ticks include the exact output in `Q/<case>/tick-<n>.json` and a
full Coordinator snapshot in `snapshot-<n>.json`. Each output contains
`routing:"tmux-workers", fixture_only:false`; that flag identifies live transport,
not production activation. Every completed tick retained both prepared wait
actions byte-for-byte (`passive_unchanged:true`).

| Case / tick | Revision before → after | State | Action outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| live / 1 | 4 → 5 | ACTIVE | live-delivery: awaiting_ready |
| live / 2 | 5 → 5 | ACTIVE | live-delivery: awaiting_ready |
| live / 3 | 5 → 5 | ACTIVE | live-delivery: awaiting_ready |
| provisioned / 1 | 4 → 5 | ACTIVE | provisioned-delivery: awaiting_ready |
| provisioned / 2 | 5 → 5 | ACTIVE | provisioned-delivery: awaiting_ack |
| provisioned / 3 | 5 → 7 | ACTIVE | provisioned-delivery: working |
| provisioned / 4 | 7 → 8 | ACTIVE | provisioned-delivery: returned |
| provisioned / 5 | 8 → 8 | ACTIVE | provisioned-delivery: returned |
| provisioned / 6 | 8 → 8 | ACTIVE | provisioned-delivery: returned |
| expiry / 1 | 4 → 5 | ACTIVE | expiry-delivery: awaiting_ready |
| expiry / 2 | 5 → 6 | HOLD | expiry-delivery: HOLD |
| expiry / 3 | 6 → 6 | HOLD | expiry-delivery: HOLD |
| uncertain / injected launch | 4 → 5 | process exit 75 | No completed tick output; real launch preceded exit |
| uncertain / recovery 1 | 5 → 5 | HOLD | uncertain-delivery: HOLD |
| uncertain / recovery 2 | 5 → 5 | HOLD | uncertain-delivery: HOLD |

The required completion/idempotence sequence is provisioned ticks **4, 5, 6**.
The second and third ticks in that sequence make no additional worker or
Coordinator mutation. Tick boot/health bookkeeping still occurs; they are not
byte-for-byte no-ops on the owner SQLite database. Startup and inference require
polling across ticks; no single immediate tick is claimed to await all inference.

## Exact real-worker ACK, START and RETURN

Worker run: `Q/r/w-3l01ggne`; PID **6960**; TMUX server **6959**.
Claim: `56a24e38-a14e-49ec-b1e9-50d7666f34f4`.
Session/thread: `01a0a426-7bf7-77a1-b659-0e8f82f8ff71`.
START work turn: `01a0a427-5e78-77d0-b061-4274b735bd27`.

Exact first completed assistant message:

```text
ACK provisioned-delivery 04783cadbd5904ef263f616a26760a37e4b0b60aab29c40e8aebe0f697904e23 gpt-6-astra high
```

The real transport compared this completed assistant message to the frozen ACK.
The harness independently asserted UTF-8 byte equality of the whole line and of
the digest token against the Coordinator action and recomputed allocation digest.
See [verification.json](/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915/verification.json).

`prompt-intent.json`, `prompt-keys.json`, `start-intent.json` and `start-keys.json`
record the actual delivery. The transport sent bracketed-paste text and Enter in
separate TMUX calls. It sent **START** once. The correlated rollout user message
and matching runtime turn prove submission; the 08:20:39Z pane visibly shows
`START` and `Working (0s • esc to interrupt)`. Key delivery receipts alone retain
`accepted:false` and are not counted as proof of working.

Exact second completed assistant message:

````text
RETURN
/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915/provisioned/scratch/proof.txt
```text
daemon qualification proof
```
````

The scratch file was independently checked as exactly
`b'daemon qualification proof\n'`. Completed-rollout SHA-256:
`e032aa9dcfc6070922d39e1b77fe1f8a117abd08a7057c9acac1dc78647b7356`.
Raw rollout:
`Q/r/w-3l01ggne/home/sessions/2026/09/15/rollout-2026-09-15T01-19-40-01a0a426-7bf7-77a1-b659-0e8f82f8ff71.jsonl`.
Selected real session, runtime, submission, response and completion events are
preserved in `Q/provisioned/correlated-rollout-events.json`.

The owner DB contains all eleven effects in `applied` phase: claim, prepare,
launch, prompt, ack, dispatched, acknowledged, start, working, return_observed,
returned. It contains no hold for this action. Coordinator status is `returned`,
not verified or accepted. Full tables and process provenance are retained in
`Q/provisioned/summary.json`.

## Four live safety demonstrations

> **Concurrency disclosure (independent review, September 15).** The 301-second
> SDK suite ran from 08:18:14Z to 08:23:15Z, overlapping every live tick
> (08:18:15Z–08:21:40Z) including the real, unmocked five-second lease deadline.
> The suite used a separate `Q/suite-home` and PYTHONPATH and nothing observed is
> invalidated — the expiry case was expected to expire — but a receipt that leans
> on a real 5 s deadline should record that the host was simultaneously running a
> full test suite. Future timing-sensitive lanes should run unloaded.

1. **Prepared non-worker actions remain untouched — PASS.** Every fixture has
   security/accounting wait actions. Across healthy ACTIVE ticks, including the
   completed lifecycle, their full Coordinator records remain identical and
   prepared. No worker run or operation is created for either. This live case
   covers `wait`; coverage of the other excluded kinds remains SDK evidence.
2. **Expired lease with surviving PID — PASS.** The expiry allocation has a real
   five-second deadline, with no clock mocking. PID **7161** remained alive with
   its original process identity. Tick 2 recorded `terminal_status:lease_expired`
   and a `lease_expired` hold; watchdog moved revision 5→6. Tick 3 remained HOLD
   at revision 6, with one launch/run. Transport liveness correctly still says
   `alive`; the expired lease is dead for dispatch purposes and never renewed.
   See `Q/expiry/summary.json` for the simultaneous alive observation and expired
   owner process record. No ACK or inference was needed for this timeout case.

   **Scope of this demonstration (independent review, September 15).** This lane
   used the unmodified adapter, so its worker was still sitting at the same
   update/trust startup checkpoint documented for the `live` lane: the summary
   records `ready:false` and the same generic `pane_digest` (`56442b5d…`) as the
   never-started `uncertain` worker, with no session, thread or ack fields. What
   is therefore proven is **"the lease deadline elapsed while the worker was
   never ready"**, not "the lease expired on a worker that was actually running a
   turn". The daemon behaviour observed is real and is the behaviour we want, but
   expiry against a genuinely mid-turn worker is **not yet demonstrated** and is
   added to the startup-fix follow-up below.
3. **Kill after durable RETURN — PASS in provisioned lane.** At revision 7 the
   Coordinator still said `running`, while the real completed rollout already
   contained RETURN. At 08:21:27Z the harness sent SIGKILL to the identified PID
   **6960**. The next observation showed `pane_dead:1`, `liveness:crashed`, no
   survivors and the same correlated RETURN. Tick 4 recorded returned at revision
   8; ticks 5/6 preserved it. `before-kill.json`, `after-kill.json`, `tick-4.json`
   and the correlated rollout retain the ordering. No post-death keys or new
   process were used to recover the result.
4. **Uncertain effect holds rather than retrying — PASS.** A dedicated harness
   mode calls the real `Worker.launch`, records actual PID **7201** and then
   exits the owner process with code 75 before the daemon's launch receipt can
   be written. Transport intent/client/process artifacts survive; the daemon
   operation has an unreceipted intent. Recovery tick 1 records `effect_uncertain`
   and HOLD at revision 5; recovery tick 2 retains HOLD and the same revision.
   There is exactly one worker run, no prompt/START receipt and no relaunch.
   The empty owner process table is expected: the crash preceded the daemon
   observation insert. Actual TMUX/process evidence lives under
   `Q/r/w-3hl3tty1`; see `Q/uncertain/summary.json` and the fault log.

## Commands, artifacts and cleanup

Preflight first ran `shasum -a 256` and read the named brief, then read
`owner-daemon.md`, `owner-tmux.md`, `owner_daemon.py`, `owner_tmux.py`, relevant
Coordinator/test helpers, root policy, product heading, active plan/sprint,
`docs/development/test-isolation.md`, and the development/TUI skills. Read-only
`git status --short`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, and `git branch --show-current`
confirmed a clean frozen checkout and the assigned branch. Manager launch
contract was read from `/private/tmp/fmgr.Q1SIYZ/dispatch.py`; it was never run.
No production-state inspection was used to obtain its configuration.

Q was created mode 0700, followed by `Q/r` and `Q/suite-home`. The disposable
harness was created and amended only under Q; this receipt is the only repository
file changed. It records commands and exact Python API operations in its source.
Every invocation below used `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -B Q/qualify.py`:

```text
init live
suite                         # separate guarded-environment Python SDK process
checks
 tick live; inspect live      # notation lists sequential harness invocations
# Direct fixture TMUX navigation: send-keys Down, then send-keys Enter (Skip).
inspect live; tick live; tick live
init provisioned; tick-provisioned provisioned
inspect provisioned; tick provisioned
init expiry 5; tick expiry
init uncertain; tick-crash uncertain  # actual process exit 75, retained
 tick provisioned; inspect provisioned; tick expiry; tick uncertain
 tick expiry; tick uncertain; inspect provisioned
kill-return provisioned
 tick provisioned; tick provisioned; tick provisioned
summary expiry; summary uncertain; summary provisioned
verify
summary live
cleanup provisioned; cleanup live; cleanup expiry; cleanup uncertain
```

The chronological, timestamped command journal resolves this compact inventory;
semicolon notation above is descriptive, not a claim that all calls shared one
shell command. Raw outputs were additionally checked using `tail` on the SDK log.
Every tick has a target guard and before/after revision. Inspection saves separate
`inspect-<time>.json` and `pane-<time>.txt` attempts, including startup failures.
Snapshots, summaries, eleven operation request/receipt chains, transport manifests,
rollout and original failed/crashed attempts remain under Q.

Cleanup qualified all four fixture sessions as `clean:true`: the RETURN worker
was already killed by its test, and the three startup-blocked fixture PIDs were
sent SIGTERM without typing into any update/trust prompt. Transport close then
confirmed dead pane, no observed surviving children, server exit and failed
session probe. No global TMUX kill was used. Auth symlinks were unlinked without
following them, and fixture owner rows set OFF. See each `cleanup.json` and
`commands.jsonl`. This is observed-process cleanup, not hostile-child containment.

## Automated validation

**591 tests passed in 301.254 seconds**, exit 0 (301.651 seconds wall time).
Only the previously documented HTTP 500/429 fixture-cleanup ResourceWarnings
appeared. No failure, retry or native credential prompt was observed. Raw output:
[sdk-suite.log](/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915/sdk-suite.log).
The log's synthetic publication messages belong to tests; they do not indicate a
production publication or activation by this qualification harness.

The full suite uses the established SDK interpreter, `-B -m unittest discover
-s scripts/initiative_control -p '*test*.py'`, from the assigned checkout, with
`TMPDIR=/private/tmp`. Exact argv/environment/output location are in the command
journal. HOME and all profile aliases point to `Q/suite-home`; the constructed
environment excludes inherited credentials. No Rust tests were needed or run.

Governance checks passed: **3/3 active plans**, **116 current / 126 archived
sprints**. `git diff --check` passed after receipt authoring. Source and test files
remained identical to the frozen commit throughout validation; only this receipt
is committed. There was no code formatting/fix pass or Rust test campaign.

## What still blocks recurrence

- Fix and review the fresh-profile startup contract, then repeat an unassisted
  exact-package live run. Current default launch encounters update/trust prompts;
  harness profile provisioning is not a shipped fix or an unattended pass.
- Manager review/receiving of this receipt and allocation reconciliation, plus
  disposition of the provisioned-lane limitation. No approval is inferred.
- The existing combined functional handoff still requires fresh code-blind cases,
  independently confined execution and evidence review, including enforced
  filesystem/process/IPC/network/credential boundaries and negative probes.
  This code-aware implementation-worker run is supporting engineering evidence,
  not independent acceptance. Any internal-stage N/A requires integrator acceptance.
- Outstanding manager/receiving/verification, Slack decision/ACK, packaged
  supervision and broader recovery evidence remain governed by PF-80-S01 and
  the owner-daemon/owner-tmux records; this bounded worker-only run does not close
  them. No TensorCash/Isometric, benchmark, release or named-human acceptance
  evidence was produced here.
- Production activation requires the manager's separate explicit decision and
  notifying Travis. This assignment authorizes neither that activation nor
  launchd installation. No recurrence was activated, no Slack message sent and
  no branch/release pushed.

## Follow-up — September 15, 2026: owner-daemon-impl-06

**Unassisted startup and mid-turn expiry passed for this exact package and
disposable fixture.** This follow-up supersedes the startup/mid-turn gaps for
the revised source only. All preceding text, failed startup attempts, timing
disclosures and limitations are preserved. Recurrence remains OFF.

Classification: product initiative revision within active
`docs/plans/active/initiative-delivery-control.md`, PF-80-S01 (`in_progress`).
Product heading: **Internal delivery control — TO BUILD**; requirement excerpt:
“durable event dispatch, acknowledgments and watchdog” and “initialize and
rehearse all three workstreams before enabling recurring operation.”
The exact worker coordinates below come from the frozen manager allocation;
reconciliation into shared plan/sprint records remains manager-owned.

- Allocation: `owner-daemon-impl-06`; worker OpenAI `gpt-6-astra`, High.
- Allocation digest: `05aa5d37a1044672377cd243f4ac8fd350b99a2797dc54d406b6668e5afee9ff`.

- Worktree: `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/bootstrap-owner-daemon-c-20260915`.

### Startup contract and exact source

`TmuxAdapter.prepare` writes mode-0600 `home/config.toml` in the existing
mode-0700 private profile before launch:

```toml
check_for_update_on_startup = false
[tui]
animations = false
[analytics]
enabled = false
[projects."<exact binding worktree>"]
trust_level = "trusted"
```

The worktree key is derived solely from `binding["worktree"]` and escaped as a
TOML basic string using `json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False)`. There is exactly
one project entry: no parent, sibling or hardcoded repository is trusted.
`Worker.launch` adds exactly these manager-dispatch startup overrides:

```text
-c check_for_update_on_startup=false
-c tui.animations=false
-c analytics.enabled=false
```

The full argv still contains `--no-alt-screen -C <binding worktree> --model
<binding model>`, the existing model/provider/effort overrides, and unchanged
`--sandbox <binding sandbox> --ask-for-approval <binding approval>`.
Project trust comes from the private config. The auth symlink, restricted
environment, readiness/ACK/START/provenance checks and visible prompt refusal
are unchanged. Nothing auto-answers or suppresses credential, authentication
or permission prompts; no such prompt was observed.

Artifact root **F**:
`/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915/20260915-06`.
The executable [qualify.py](/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915/20260915-06/qualify.py)
adapts the earlier disposable harness. Its replay path calls the actual revised
transport without monkeypatching prepare/launch or provisioning any extra
profile settings. It preserves frozen allocations, checked target guards,
actual key delivery, observations, per-tick snapshots, source patch and logs.
`tested-source.json` and `source.patch` bind the tested implementation to the base:

- `owner_tmux.py` SHA-256: `8f9ae08e7d98a24ffe5e7c2092f0efa082f1f0a8f1e05a48ed8a7b1d0d853cad`.
- `test_owner_tmux.py`: `02da23dd052869c6e2ddd52cc9ec241a4c717bb3b6fd1bb4aa8d03247d73f5bf`.
- Daemon package digest: `3ee535d78819f7a3d6b7112b29561cf76f1b388e336b0b677d317eba403c0645`.
- Same pinned Corbanu **0.1.41** binary/path as the original receipt; SHA-256
  `4a8eba7b10199ea49aee42a720687b63cb4b1b2194c2ce164d1b9f6f88ee510e`.
- The daemon and daemon tests are unchanged: **531/660** and **745/780** lines.
  Transport/test counts are **370/621**, with no assigned ceilings.

No new trace/log-dir override was added: the exact transport is exercised, as
requested. The test-tui actual-key method is used; raw panes/rollouts provide
evidence, with the earlier trace-setting limitation retained.

### Fixture-only targeting and inference

Fresh Coordinators exist only at `F/live/state` and `F/expiry/state`. Each
config is loaded through a guard requiring its resolved target to equal that
case's disposable state under F and rejecting the production state path
`.codex-work/initiative-control.oGQGyA/state`. No production Coordinator was
opened or targeted. The similarly named SDK dependency directory is only a
Python site-packages path.

Each case has a fresh empty scratch Git repository, one implement allocation
and two passive waits. Offline fixture activation records explicitly identify
`owner-daemon-impl-06` and disposable-only authority. They are not production
activation records. The transport creates the assigned auth symlink without
opening/copying/hashing/printing its contents; all profile aliases point to the
new private home. This is the same explicitly linked-auth inference contract
as the preceding live qualification, not synthetic-credential or enforced
malicious-worker isolation. No live profile was used as a test home.

### Unassisted live result

At **08:59:22.133Z**, real worker PID **20085** had `ready:true`, `ack:true`,
`submitted:true`, `returned:null`, a valid process identity and a correlated
START turn. Thread: `01a0a44a-a9d0-77d1-88c4-513199e9c615`;
work turn: `01a0a44a-d091-7be0-8981-207ef625152f`.

```text
ACK live-delivery eb1f4acdf0509a5776a24758913bea6ba527ce54fa80068ff3306a371e332d6e gpt-6-astra high
```

The ACK was byte-exact. The transport sent prompt text and Enter separately,
then START text and Enter separately. No human keys, update Skip, trust approval
or harness profile patch occurred. The worker wrote exactly
`b'daemon qualification proof\n'` to `F/live/scratch/proof.txt` and completed a
correlated RETURN containing that path and content. `live/working.json`,
`live/verification.json`, raw panes, rollout and key receipts retain the proof.

| Lane/tick | Revision | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| live/1 | 4 → 5 | awaiting_ready |
| live/2 | 5 → 5 | awaiting_ack |
| live/3 | 5 → 7 | working |
| live/4 | 7 → 8 | returned |
| live/5–6 | 8 → 8 | returned; no new launch or delivery |
| expiry/1 | 4 → 5 | awaiting_ready |
| expiry/2 | 5 → 5 | awaiting_ack |
| expiry/3 | 5 → 7 | working |
| expiry/4 | 7 → 8 | HOLD; lease_expired |
| expiry/5–6 | 8 → 8 | HOLD; no relaunch |

Both passive waits remain byte-for-byte unchanged across every tick.
`live/summary.json` retains all eleven lifecycle operations in applied phase.

### EXPIRED-LEASE against a worker actually mid-turn

The expiry replay uses an original, frozen **180-second lease**, allowing real
startup and ACK inference, and observes its final five seconds. This is
explicitly a longer allocation than the previous five-second startup-timeout
fixture. No clock was mocked, deadline shortened/extended, lease renewed or
state patched after claim. `expiry/fixed-lease.json` records deadline
**09:03:03.307397Z** (epoch `1789462983.3073971`).

Real worker PID **20423** reached working at **09:00:15Z**, then invoked
`/bin/sleep 300` at **09:00:19.364Z** through the actual execution tool.
That deliberate, harmless pending command keeps the correlated START turn
active across the original lease; it accesses no files, credentials or network.

```

At **09:02:58.312Z**, `five-seconds-before-expiry.json` and its pane show
`ready:true`, exact ACK, submitted START, no RETURN and the same live PID.
The pane displays Working and one background terminal. The real tool call is
retained in `midturn-tool-calls.json`. At **09:03:06.914Z**, after the expiry
tick, `expired-alive.json` still shows that PID, the same start identity,
submitted turn, no RETURN and live descendants. The process snapshot in
`surviving-processes.txt` identifies sleep PID **20630** and its code-mode host.

`expiry/verification.json` and `summary.json` prove owner process
`terminal_status:lease_expired`, a durable `lease_expired` hold, and exactly
one launch and one worker run after three HOLD ticks. Subsequent ticks add the
existing `operation_held` refusal while retaining the original expiry hold.
The daemon does not relaunch, renew or terminate the surviving worker.

**No SDK suite ran concurrently with the lease or its final five-second
window.** Focused tests finished at **08:58:50.759Z**, before live replay.
Expiry finished at **09:03:07.803Z**; the full SDK suite began at
**09:03:40.417Z**. Lanes ran sequentially without a concurrent test/build
campaign. Recorded load was 2.70 before live and 3.44 before expiry on 24 logical
CPUs; ordinary desktop processes remained active. The load snapshots and
timestamped `commands.jsonl` preserve the actual shared-host conditions.

### Cleanup and scope of the result

Live cleanup at **08:59:52Z** returned `clean:true`. Both disposable owner modes
were set OFF, and both auth symlinks were removed without following them.
No recurrence, launchd job, Slack message, production activation, push or
release was performed.

Expiry cleanup deliberately killed the worker after the proof. Its first
`cleanup.json` accurately records **clean:false**: sleep PID 20630 outlived the
parent. The transport did not silently treat this as clean or kill that child.
The separate [cleanup-residual.py](/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915/20260915-06/cleanup-residual.py)
checked the saved child start identity and exact `/bin/sleep` executable,
sent fixture-only SIGTERM, then called transport close again.
`cleanup-residual.json` records **clean:true** at **09:04:06Z**, with no survivors
and the dedicated TMUX server gone. The original failed cleanup receipt remains.
This residual cleanup overlapped the beginning of the SDK suite, after every
lease assertion was complete; no SDK/deadline overlap occurred. Autonomous
descendant cleanup/shutdown remains separate qualification work.

These runs are code-aware engineering evidence from the implementation worker.
They do not provide independent code-blind acceptance, enforced containment,
live TensorCash/Isometric qualification, benchmarks or named-human acceptance.
Manager review/receiving and plan/sprint allocation reconciliation remain open.
The combined functional gate still needs independent design, confined execution
with negative access probes and separate evidence review; internal-stage N/A
requires integrator acceptance. Manager inference/receiving/verification, Slack
decision/ACK, packaged supervision and broader recovery gates remain as above.
Production activation still requires the separate manager decision and notice
to Travis; no approval is inferred from these passes.

### Follow-up automated validation

Two added regressions verify a private config containing only the exact project
(including spaces/dots/quotes/backslash/Unicode) and the complete launch argv
under all nine existing sandbox/approval combinations. Existing visible-auth
prompt refusal and real-TMUX lifecycle tests remain in the run.

Focused transport: **30 passed in 21.663s**. Full SDK: **593 passed in 300.920s**,
exit 0, from **09:03:40.417Z–09:08:41.711Z** (301.294s wall time). Only the
existing HTTP 500/429 fixture-cleanup ResourceWarnings appeared; no test failed,
no retry was needed and no native credential prompt occurred. Synthetic
publication/activation messages in the suite log are test output only.
Raw output: [suite.log](/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/daemon-qualify-20260915/20260915-06/suite.log).
The exact interpreter, argv and constructed environment are in
`F/commands.jsonl`; command suffix:
`-B -m unittest discover -s scripts/initiative_control -p '*test*.py'`.
`TMPDIR=/private/tmp`; HOME and all three profile aliases point to the empty
`F/suite-home`; inherited inference credentials are excluded and
`CORBANU_TEST_DISABLE_NATIVE_KEYRING=1`. No Rust tests were in scope or run.

Governance checks passed: **3/3 active plans; 116 current / 126 archived sprints**.
Only the transport, its tests and these two allocated evidence documents change.
Final `git diff --check` passed. `F/final-verification.json` records unchanged
tested source hashes, preservation of the complete original receipt, OFF fixture
modes, removed auth links, single launch/prompt/START per lane, unchanged passive
waits, eleven applied live effects and the disclosed final cleanup results.
