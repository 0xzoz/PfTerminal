# PF-80-S01 bounded owner manager cycle

Original frozen, uncommitted worker handoff, September 13, 2026. Product initiative under
**Internal delivery control — TO BUILD**: “Use sequential sprints per initiative”
and the September 13 authorization for “fresh Fable 5.1 High management through
Corbanu/TMUX; durable event dispatch”. PF-80-S01 remains `in_progress` in the active
`docs/plans/active/initiative-delivery-control.md` plan; this unit does not close it.

Worktree `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/manager-cycle-20260913`, branch
`bootstrap/manager-cycle-20260913`, base `bca6485a2e60803393bbca0ee56d98953022ed12`.
The parent's canonical allocation is the **Event-to-manager driver allocation**
section of `docs/research/tasknode-integration/coordinator-bootstrap-20260913.md`
in `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/management-workstreams-20260911`.
Its active plan records these worker coordinates; both parent checkers passed.
Local plan/sprint copies remain at the base; shared records belong to the parent.
Only `manager_cycle.py`, `test_manager_cycle.py` and this receipt are added.
Frozen size: 799 total lines / 373 non-test (279 implementation, 426 tests, 94 QA).
Implementation SHA-256: `f1ed9c4f96ddd7d02cf8269a2f578423afc297af9ca682b9aa04fbeda4dd661a`.
Test SHA-256: `d78696bdc564ba0f71a9318e00a1cf5bb82e5160597c80ff1e943aea4ea28d61`.

## Contract and operation

`scripts/initiative_control/manager_cycle.py` exposes `run_cycle` and an explicit
`--run` CLI. Without `--run`, it returns OFF without inspecting paths. Help and
import do not open state, credentials, processes or network. Run requires explicit
`--state`, `--runs-dir`, `--binary`, `--auth-file`, `--owner-context`; timeout defaults
to 300 seconds. State must already be initialized and private. The small existing-
store adapter reuses Coordinator operations without its creating constructor;
readiness uses read-only SQLite and subsequent connections use `mode=rw`.
Paused, empty and already-owned stores are unchanged and do not read other inputs.

Owner context is a private, non-symlink, single-link JSON file capped at 8192 bytes:
`{"observed_at":"2026-09-13T00:00:00Z","context":{"authority":"owner supplied"}}`.
Supply real dated observations, approvals, unresolved blockers and review budgets
privately. This example supplies no production authority. Stored seed metadata is
explicitly historical; durable modes/allocations are not fresh external proof.

One meaningful pending batch is claimed through `begin_manager` (at most 24 events).
The briefing includes all three streams, ordered last-three action IDs, frozen
unconsumed scopes, pending actions, and recursively loaded original evidence keyed
by verified digest. Action records retain identity, kind, workstream, sprint, status,
rationale, allocation identity/digest, other lifecycle metadata and reference digests.
Terminal actions (`accepted`, `failed`, `cancelled`) omit inline inputs and expansion
of dispatch/ACK/result/verification/owner-failure/owner-cancellation references,
except when both in the last three and represented by a status transition in the
selected pending event batch. This exception supplies their exact inputs (or the
existing lossless allocation index) and recursively verified originals. Compacted
actions retain the core-stored result, verification, owner_failure and
owner_cancellation previews, each at most 400 characters, so later managers can
read partial outcome context after the transition batch is consumed. These previews
are untrusted partial context and do not replace the omitted full originals.
Allocations with literal `inputs.consumed == true` retain metadata and only
`{"consumed":true}` as inputs; active actions never index into compact allocation
inputs. Other allocation scopes and non-terminal action inputs remain exact.

Selected event originals and everything they reference always expand in full,
including evidence also referenced by compact history. Status transitions are read
from selected top-level event originals: returned/verified action IDs, exact
reconciled-dispatch IDs, owner completion/successor action IDs, owner allocation
cancellations and explicit matching action/status records. Nested evidence, unrelated
mentions and deferred events do not establish this exception. FIFO batch sizing
recomputes eligibility for each selected prefix before restricting the durable claim.

`evidence_omissions` identifies each affected action/allocation by `source`, `id` and
`reason`; `inputs_digest` hashes the exact omitted inputs and `evidence_digests`
lists reference roots whose originals were not expanded elsewhere. Unloaded roots
also identify their unexpanded descendants; they are not fetched just to enumerate
omissions. This is unavailable context, never a success claim. The untouched core
packet remains in `claim.json`. Derived previews are removed only at known reference
positions, except for the four compacted outcome fields above. Compacted action
references do not load originals; a shared reference still expands when required by
a selected event or another retained source. No original is shortened or summarized.
Missing/corrupt retained evidence,
excessive retained reference count, or a briefing exceeding the unchanged 65536
encoded bytes produces an owner hold before authentication/inference, with pending
events and the claim retained.
Rationales are strongly directed below 300 UTF-8 bytes; the unchanged core still
accepts at most 1000 bytes. Frozen inputs are never rewritten to fit acceptance.

A fresh private `m-<manager-token>/launches` directory binds exactly one synchronous
`fable_launcher.run_launcher` invocation. Use a short private runs root outside Git:
the reviewed launcher enforces its TMUX socket-path limit. Credentials are supplied
only by its explicit private auth-file interface. No credential adapter is added.
The injected callable is a trusted test/owner adapter, never model/event input.

Validation reads actual `receipt.json`, `manifest.json`, `launch.json`, copied
launcher/shell/packet, `candidate.json`, full `final.txt`, session rollout,
`process.json` and `stop`, using reviewed launcher parsing/evidence helpers.
It binds token, revision, exact briefing bytes, binary path/hash/argv, launcher hash,
fresh run/timestamps, Fable model/provider/high, session/thread/turn/response and
complete final decision. It requires the reviewed launcher's durable clean shutdown
record, session disappearance and owned-process binding. A caller boolean, PID guess
or elapsed deadline is not an alternate shutdown proof. No process is inspected or
killed by this driver. Existing Coordinator validates proposals transactionally.

Success consumes only selected events and returns durable `prepared_actions` for
the real host's claim/native-tool/ACK workflow. It performs no dispatch, integration,
Slack sends, scheduling, retry, shutdown reconciliation or initialization. Attempts
retain claim/brief/attempt/returned/validated/hold records as far as execution reached.
After an uncertain failure the owner inspects actual shutdown and core state before
using existing reconciliation. Never blindly call `fail_manager` on a timeout.
After an acceptance commit but before output, SQLite actions/audit are authoritative;
a missing `accepted.json` is not permission to repeat inference or dispatch.

## Verification and receiving handoff

Initial driver suite: 16 passed in 0.974s. Expanded system-Python suite: 80 ran,
79 passed, one existing collector test errored with `ModuleNotFoundError: slack_sdk`.
No code defect or live call was involved. Retained failure; reran using the existing
documented SDK interpreter: 80 passed in 1.934s; final frozen code: **80 passed in 1.893s**.
Counts: 21 driver, 37 Coordinator/owner-control, 7 launcher protocol, 15 collector.
Driver coverage includes 20 artifact/identity rejection subcases, recursive originals,
OFF/paused/empty/owned, stale/paused/deadline attempts, CLI, and five real child-process
exits at claim persistence, launcher entry, returned receipt, validated proof and
acceptance commit. Fixtures use real SQLite and actual artifact schemas, with an
absent credential file and no inference. Process identities are labeled synthetic.

Reproduce from this worktree with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`,
`PYTHONPATH=scripts/initiative_control` and the documented interpreter
`/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/slack-sdk-test.Ob3i5O/venv/bin/python -B -m unittest test_manager_cycle test_coordinator test_fable_launcher.Protocol test_slack_reply_poll`.
Both local governance checkers and whitespace checks pass. Existing dependencies
remain untouched. Parent owns Fable material review, receiving checks and actual
fresh-manager/native-host replay. No other agents or reviews were invoked here.
Internal-only engineering N/A follows the canonical allocation; this is not true-TUI,
TensorCash/Isometric Game, human, benchmark, release or isolated functional acceptance.
Those later applicable gates remain with the parent; recurrence stays unqualified.

## Scoped correction after original Fable review01

The original 799/373 receipt, hashes, test attempts and findings above remain
historical. Parent accepted P2 shared timeout as blocking and P3 as a narrow
read-only diagnostic correction. Original review is untouched at
`/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/bootstrap-cycle-review.WVYhMZ/review01.json`,
SHA-256 `b5a9c967e3ebabbd150964cf2203353f17285e063310cd872d16e6aafe0ffb1f`.
Parent owns material review02 under its corrective allowance, receiving tests and
actual fresh-manager/native-host replay; this worker invoked no agents or reviews.

`--timeout` now means total core claim seconds from claim creation, default300,
finite numeric range31..3600. At launch, subtract actual elapsed preparation and
a fixed30-second reserve for launcher pre-timer setup/version probe, shutdown and
validation. The launcher receives at most3570 seconds. Invalid values hold before
claiming; fewer than one remaining launcher second holds before inference and
retains the claim. A31-second window therefore needs zero preparation time to
launch; choose a larger budget for real operation. No rounding up or deadline
extension occurs. This is bounded margin, not a hard process-runtime guarantee:
overhead beyond the reserve still encounters the core's authoritative deadline
and retains ownership for reconciliation. Readiness short-circuits remain first.

Readiness remains `mode=ro`, including paused/empty/owned stores. SQLite error
code776 (`SQLITE_READONLY_ROLLBACK`) maps only to `sqlite_recovery_required`;
all other SQLite errors map to `sqlite_unavailable`. No raw exception, SQL, path
or arbitrary error name is exposed. Preflight holds have no attempt directory;
the returned fixed diagnostic is the evidence. OFF still performs no state read.

Owner recovery: first reconcile actual launcher/process state and verify the exact
existing private database path. Then deliberately open that existing store using
`c = Coordinator(Path("<verified-existing-state-directory>")); state = c.snapshot()`
in the supported owner Python environment. This existing rw API permits SQLite's
journal rollback; it is not automatic driver readiness or a new initializer.
Do not delete the journal or call `initialize`. Recheck readiness and inspect the
preserved manager/events; clearing an owned manager via existing `fail_manager`
still requires actual shutdown reconciliation, never just elapsed time. For
`sqlite_unavailable`, the owner checks locks/permissions/database health first.

Six new tests cover real core-clock late completion with12s preparation,5s launcher
setup,8s shutdown and4s validation; minimum/fractional/maximum/invalid budgets;
preparation exhaustion; real core deadline overrun; and fixed SQLite diagnostics.
The child-crash regression forces a synced hot DELETE journal via dirty-page spill
for paused/empty/owned/ready stores. Repeated probes plus OFF preserve database and
journal bytes; after the child is reaped, explicit owner Coordinator rw recovery
restores the exact pre-crash SQL dump and readiness. No live credentials/inference.

Correction verification: driver27 passed in2.422s; full86 passed in2.895s;
after adding the oversized-integer edge case, final code **86 passed in2.757s**
using the documented SDK venv command above (27 driver + original59 dependencies).
Frozen correction: **992 total / 439 non-test** (291 implementation,553 tests,148 QA),
above the800 total target, within450 non-test target and1050/600 hard ceilings.
Implementation SHA-256: `3e95db1d59c13173e31610c0914f1d1b3786b97f270c7763dfb2471c8890e411`.
Test SHA-256: `bc95c42ccc163d5bab5b297452534cda92e9dcc483b8746f6e60a5355403581f`.
Governance and whitespace checks pass; exactly three staged additions, no commit/push.

## Parent review, receiving and actual recovery rehearsal

Review02: Fable5.1High, helper exit0/no findings; original review01 retained.
Parent reproduced86 focused passes in2.663s, accepted the992/439 scope, committed
`b108c4ac81c10da2548878893e558b570754cdc9`, then received it with the actual
single-writer job at `3b25e9d9e4684df10cea505a2022db20eec04db4`.
All124 receiving tests passed73.157s, plus both governance checks and whitespace.
The durable receiving receipt is `.codex-work/bootstrap-cycle-review.WVYhMZ/receiving/receive-manager-cycle-b108c4ac8.json`,
SHA-256 `05f8f2807d455cc913814922d219a03415c85917623b426152ddcddbac003085`.

Parent ran the accepted driver against the existing real coordinator, not a fixture.
Private `/private/tmp/mc.CVU7SR/verification.json` records two complete fresh runs:
`f-h7ano0vl`, session `01a099cf-34d5-71d2-a7de-be41366923df`,34857-byte briefing;
`f-pbou3z1v`, session `01a099d0-b33e-77b1-aca9-de7888155190`,44795-byte briefing.
Both loaded `claude-fable-5-1-plan`/`claude-plan`/`high`, passed artifact validation
and core acceptance. Independent owner TMUX/ps probes confirmed both sessions
and their owned processes absent. Run homes contain credentials; never export them.

The first manager allocated a real zero-tool Astra High ACK agent, Godel
`01a099cf-b9e8-7413-9f7d-7d541daef60f`. Parent deliberately omitted the durable
dispatch recording after actual spawn, reproducing that crash window rather than
claiming the host coordinator itself crashed. After the real15-second deadline,
a fresh process recorded exactly one `dispatch_uncertain` watchdog event; another
watchdog changed nothing and a duplicate claim was rejected even when enabled.
Actual host spawn/ACK receipts reconciled the original identity and acknowledgment.
Actual close returned its completed status; the subsequent tool lookup returned
`not_found`, confirming removal (not the initially expected `shutdown` spelling).
The owner then recorded intentional failure/stop, never fabricated work completion.
The second fresh manager accepted a wait-only follow-up from that durable evidence.

At08:10:42Z, coordinator revision53: global and all three dispatch modes paused,
no manager claim; rehearsal action failed and follow-up wait prepared. No product
sprint advanced. This proves operator-invoked driver/native crash-window recovery,
not a deployed unattended controller, full Slack chain or isolated acceptance.

## September 14 briefing-size repair: scoped worker return

Action `briefing-size-repair-01`, bounded internal reliability fix under
**Internal delivery control — TO BUILD**: “Use sequential sprints per initiative”.
Assigned worktree `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/bootstrap-briefing-size-20260914`,
branch `bootstrap/briefing-size-20260914`, base
`c7ee093bc6a35c9fdd3f63d8f6bf49495cf61087`. The contract above describes the
implemented selection rules. Coordinator state, original evidence, claim limits and
authentication/inference boundaries are unchanged.

Synthetic measurement uses `BriefingSizeTests.large_packet` in
`scripts/initiative_control/manager_cycle_test.py`: one pending event, three
terminal actions with distinct dispatch/ACK/result/verification originals and one
consumed allocation with a referenced original. The base briefing holds at 65536;
its complete encoding measures **245123 bytes**, versus **7197 bytes** after this
repair. To count the rejected base output, only the base module's encoder ceiling
was bypassed in memory; production `BRIEF_LIMIT` remains **65536**. No original was
truncated. The new tests also cover terminal statuses, both recent-transition
conditions, nested/shared originals, consumed allocation input safety, omission
digests, missing/corrupt/size-mismatched retained evidence and FIFO batch restriction.

Verification commands and actual outcomes:

- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/initiative_control -p '*_test.py'`:
  **12 passed** (new regression module).
- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=scripts/initiative_control /Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/slack-sdk-test.Ob3i5O/venv/bin/python -B -m unittest test_manager_cycle test_coordinator test_fable_launcher.Protocol test_slack_reply_poll manager_cycle_test`:
  **120 ran; 117 passed, one failure, two errors**. The same existing focused
  modules using the base implementation loaded in memory pass **108/108**.
- Initial system-Python README discovery (`test_*.py`): **301 ran; six failures,
  twelve errors**, including missing `markdown_it`/`slack_sdk`, a subprocess
  `PYTHONPATH` failure and four launcher-environment failures. These are retained
  as failed evidence, not a passing full-suite claim.
- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 docs/sprints/check.py` and
  `git diff --check`: passed.

**Initial scope blocker (resolved by the manager extension below):** the existing suite is actually
`scripts/initiative_control/test_manager_cycle.py`, outside this allocation's
explicit writable paths. Three tests still require terminal inputs inline:
`test_frozen_inputs_that_resemble_references_are_not_rewritten`,
`test_repeated_action_inputs_are_losslessly_indexed` and
`test_historical_or_nonidentical_action_inputs_stay_inline`. Their fixtures need
to use non-terminal actions to retain their original lossless-input coverage under
the new contract. That file is untouched; the existing suite is not green and this
return is not an acceptance claim. The manager must authorize the corrected test
path before those three fixture adjustments and a final rerun.

This is internal packet serialization, with no interactive product change. The
prior internal-only N/A scope applies; parent still owns actual fresh-manager
replay, evidence review and any later applicable functional/release qualification.
No live coordinator, credentials or inference were used, and no push was performed.

### Manager-authorized fixture adaptation

The manager extended writable scope to `scripts/initiative_control/test_manager_cycle.py`
for exactly the three conflicting fixtures above. Terminal cases now assert exact
`evidence_omissions` input/reference digests and unchanged claim inputs; running
cases retain the prior complete inline/indexed-input assertions. An AST comparison
confirms that exactly those three test methods changed. The 64 KiB hold,
`evidence_count_hold`, full-original and event-ordering tests remain unchanged.

The documented focused command above now passes **120/120** in **8.632s**.
Full discovery includes the README's `test_*.py` suite and the new `*_test.py`
module via the superset pattern `*test*.py`. Dependencies come from the existing
SDK interpreter and the existing initiative-control Markdown package directory;
no shared environment was modified. Exact command:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
PYTHONPATH=scripts/initiative_control:/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/initiative-control.oGQGyA/venv/lib/python3.14/site-packages \
/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/slack-sdk-test.Ob3i5O/venv/bin/python -B \
-m unittest discover -s scripts/initiative_control -p '*test*.py'
```

First dependency-complete full run: **494 ran; 487 passed, seven failures** in
**299.696s**, all in unchanged `test_fable_launcher.RealTmux` cases:
forced cleanup, late abort, management vocabulary, SIGTERM, interrupted-buffer
cleanup, timeout/partial final and two fresh runs. A diagnostic single-test replay
also failed and identified `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` in the synthetic binary's
five-second `--version` probe, before TMUX launch. Subsequent direct probes
succeeded; the unchanged two-fresh-runs case then passed **1/1 in 6.654s**.
No launcher code, timeouts, assertions or test exclusions were changed. These
failed attempts remain part of the evidence.

Final replay of the exact full-discovery command above: **494/494 passed in
276.132s**, with zero failures, errors or skips. This includes the unchanged real
TMUX launcher cases and all twelve new briefing regression tests. The test and
implementation tree was unchanged between the failed full attempt and this
passing replay. Whitespace checks pass. The scope blocker is resolved; the
synthetic briefing measurement remains **245123 → 7197 bytes** with the unchanged
65536-byte production limit. Parent still owns live-manager acceptance; no push
or release is claimed.

### September 14 terminal outcome preview repair

Action `briefing-previews-01`, allocation digest
`6557ec41aaf752d415cce0cd20dab53694e2d2e43891fae22b95489c86fa10e6`.
Bounded internal reliability follow-up to accepted compaction `673773188`, review P3,
under **Internal delivery control — TO BUILD**: “fresh Fable 5.1 High management
through Corbanu/TMUX; durable event dispatch”. Assigned branch
`bootstrap/previews-20260914`, worktree
`/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/bootstrap-previews-20260914`, base
`a51602037877d7dfdcdd626fe39de26a6379b8d2`.

The four terminal outcome previews now survive compaction after a transition batch
is consumed. Owner failure/cancellation originals follow the same omission rules
as result/verification originals. Selected-event and other retained-source evidence
still expands fully, including shared references; omission digests describe only
unexpanded roots. The core packet is unchanged and previews are copied as stored,
without loading or summarizing omitted originals.

The unchanged `BriefingSizeTests.large_packet` measures **7197 → 9928 bytes**
(**+2731 bytes**, including the directive change) by loading the assigned base
module in memory and passing both versions the same synthetic packet. No encoder
ceiling was bypassed; production `BRIEF_LIMIT` remains **65536 bytes**.
Two new regression tests cover all three terminal statuses, all four outcome
fields, consumed-transition behavior, forbidden original reads and bounded
Unicode preview growth. Existing terminal/shared-evidence expectations are updated.
Against the base module, the two new tests produce three expected status-subcase
failures and one expected oversized-briefing error; against the repair they pass.

Focused SDK command: the full-discovery environment above with
`-m unittest manager_cycle_test test_manager_cycle`: **48/48 passed in 1.749s**.
Internal serialization only: the prior internal-only functional/TUI N/A applies.
The parent retains fresh-manager replay, independent evidence review and later
applicable functional/release qualification. No live state or credentials were
used; no push or release is authorized by this repair.

Final full-suite command:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
PYTHONPATH=scripts/initiative_control:/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/initiative-control.oGQGyA/venv/lib/python3.14/site-packages \
/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/slack-sdk-test.Ob3i5O/venv/bin/python -B \
-m unittest discover -s scripts/initiative_control -p '*test*.py'
```

**496/496 passed in 275.159s**, zero failures, errors or skips, including
`test_fable_launcher.RealTmux`. No replay was needed. Python emitted two cleanup
ResourceWarnings for synthetic HTTP 500/429 error fixtures; the suite exited zero.
All implementation/test edits preceded this run; only this result was appended
afterward. `git diff --check` passed.

## Terminal-history manifests are omitted — September 15, 2026

Fresh-manager runs began failing `briefing_size_hold` on every attempt: the
fixed floor (before any event was selected) had grown past the unchanged 64 KiB
`BRIEF_LIMIT`. Cause: a compacted terminal action still inlined its frozen
`scope` and `resources`. Those are allocation copies, not outcomes, and an
18-path Rust write scope cost more than the rest of the action record — the two
blocked PF-60-S02 dispatch attempts were ~3 KB each, almost half of it manifest.

Compaction now also removes `scope` and `resources` from a compacted terminal
action and records their canonical digest as `allocated_digest` on the existing
omission entry. The retained `allocation` key still names the allocation that
froze them, the claim retains the exact manifest, and outcome previews,
verification and receipt references are unchanged. Running, prepared and
returned actions keep their manifests in full.

Two further redundancies were removed in the same pass:

- A consumed allocation stub already reduced to `{consumed, original_digest}`
  hides nothing, so it is retained verbatim instead of being replaced by an
  omission entry that only restates the same digest.
`evidence_digests` is deliberately left alone. A first attempt filtered out
digests that were already visible on the retained record; that was wrong and is
reverted. The list reports which evidence **bodies** the manager cannot read, not
which digest strings happen to appear, and `manager_cycle_test.BriefingSizeTests`
encodes exactly that contract. The saving was not worth weakening the meaning.

Measured on the live state (12 actions, 45 consumed allocations): 67,843 →
65,043 bytes at one selected event, restoring headroom without touching the
limit. `BRIEF_LIMIT` remains **65536**; no ceiling was bypassed. The adaptive
prefix search still selects the largest fitting batch, so a wider event batch
holds and defers rather than truncating silently.

Regression tests: `test_terminal_history_omits_allocated_scope_but_keeps_its_digest`
proves the omission, the digest, and that the claim still carries the manifest;
`test_running_actions_keep_their_scope` proves non-terminal actions are untouched.

## Spent allocations collapse to a digest index — September 15, 2026

Fresh manager runs were failing `briefing_size_hold` on nearly every attempt,
and the manager had taken to hand-trimming its own context to squeeze under the
ceiling. That is the wrong shape of fix: it makes the briefing smaller by making
it less useful, and it hides a cost that keeps growing.

The cost was spent allocations. A stub reduced to `{consumed, original_digest}`
still occupied a full object — `sprint`, `kinds`, `resources`, `scope` and
`timeout_seconds`, all of them placeholder values reading "consumed". With 65
such stubs that was **14,574 bytes**, larger than every live allocation combined,
to communicate nothing a manager could act on.

They are now collapsed into one `consumed_allocations` map of id → frozen
original digest. The originals remain in the `allocation_versions` audit table
and are unchanged; only the placeholder repetition is gone. A stub carrying
anything beyond the bare marker still gets a full `evidence_omissions` entry, so
nothing that might hide content is collapsed silently.

Measured on the live state (12 actions, 65 spent allocations, one selected
event): **66,020 → 55,350 bytes**. The briefing also fits four selected events
where it previously fit one.

Regressions: `test_minimal_consumed_stubs_collapse_into_a_digest_index` proves
the collapse, the digest, the absence of an omission entry and that live
allocations are untouched; `test_richer_consumed_stub_still_reports_an_omission`
proves anything richer keeps its omission entry.

### The 10 KiB grant, and handing it back

Travis granted a temporary extra 10 KiB while this was unresolved. It was taken,
recorded in code and tests, and **handed back the same day** once the fix landed,
because the fix recovered more than the grant. `BRIEF_LIMIT` is 65536 again.

He then granted a standing **15 KiB reserve** (`BRIEF_RESERVE`) to draw on
pre-emptively if the manager gets stuck again. It is held at zero draw. Drawing
on it means setting `BRIEF_GRANT` to the amount used, never above the reserve,
and recording the reason here — and treating it as a debt to repay by removing
the underlying cost rather than as a larger normal.

## Locate the files before freezing a scope — September 15, 2026

Four workers stopped on the same manager mistake in one session, each costing a
full round:

- `acct-cleanup-01` — the leak fixtures and the provider check live in
  `core/src/accounting_policy_tests.rs` and `core/src/memory_stage_one.rs`, and
  neither was in the frozen scope.
- `acct-cleanup-03` — the provider-publication fix needs
  `core/src/session/mod.rs` and `core/src/session/turn_context.rs`; same error,
  second time.
- `acct-cleanup-02` — `brief_file` still pointed at the superseded brief while
  `brief_sha256` had been updated, so the digest check refused, correctly.
- `owner-daemon-qualify-fixes-01` — D09 needs `decision_alerts.py` and D14 needs
  `decision_feed.py`; both omitted.

Every one of those workers was right to stop, and the receipts say so. The cost
is a dispatch round each time, plus the reviewer's and the manager's attention.

**Before freezing a scope, locate the files rather than predicting them.** Run
the search that the task will have to run — `rg -l` for the symbol, the fixture
name, the failing test — and put what it returns into the scope. Guessing from
the shape of the repository looks efficient and is not: a plausible path list
that omits one file produces a correct stop, not a smaller diff.

The same applies to `brief_file` and `brief_sha256`: change them together or not
at all. They are a pair, and the worker verifies the pair before doing anything,
which is the behaviour we want.

## Reserve drawn and returned: 13 KiB then 0, 2026-09-16

**The draw was wrong and it is returned to zero.** I drew 13 KiB against the
15 KiB reserve, then measured instead of guessing again, and the measurement
says the reserve cannot fix this.

Actual briefing size: **101,561 bytes**. Against 65,536 plus the full 15 KiB
reserve that is still roughly 20 KiB over. Drawing the remainder would have
bought nothing and left a drawn grant standing as a false fix.

Where the bytes are:

| Section | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| `original_evidence` | 46,350 |
| `actions` | 19,620 |
| `consumed_allocations` | 9,965 |
| `sprints` | 6,125 |
| `allocations` | 4,359 |

`original_evidence` is 46% of the briefing on its own, and it is expanded
evidence bodies. **That cost is mine.** Over this session I recorded long prose
verdicts in `verify()` evidence — reasoning about why a worker stopped, what a
review found, what a gate did and did not establish. Each was worth writing, but
they are inlined into every subsequent briefing, so the manager pays for all of
them on every cycle, forever.

Compaction still helped and was done first: the `s02-receiving-verify-01`
allocation had the full receiving assignment embedded, 5,806 bytes, and
collapsed to a stub once `complete_sprint` and `archive_sprint` had executed and
nothing revalidated it.

**The actual fix is one of two things, and it is a design decision rather than a
budget one:** keep verification evidence terse and put the reasoning in the
repository where it is read once, or have the briefing reference evidence bodies
by digest instead of inlining them. Until one of those lands, new manager cycles
cannot be prepared. Direct coordinator operations, reviews and receives are
unaffected.

### Original draw note, retained

#### Reserve drawn: 13 KiB, 2026-09-16

`BRIEF_GRANT` set to 13 KiB against the standing 15 KiB `BRIEF_RESERVE`. This is
the first draw; it was held at zero all session.

**Why.** A day of dispatch left the allocation index at about 35 KiB, up from
roughly 23 KiB when briefings last fit. Compaction was run first and was not
enough: several allocations cannot be collapsed yet because their actions are
still non-terminal, and the two lifecycle allocations (`s02-complete-01`,
`s02-receiving-verify-01`) must keep their full inputs because
`complete_sprint` validates `receiving_action` against them, so a consumed stub
fails validation. Compacting them is what produced `KeyError: receiving_action`.

**What it unblocks.** Registering `PF-60-S03` in coordinator state, which is the
only thing standing between the accounting lane and real S03 implementation
work.

**The debt.** This is a debt to repay by removing the underlying cost, not a
larger normal. The repayment is mechanical: once today's actions reach terminal
status their allocations compact, and the index should fall back below the
original 64 KiB limit. `BRIEF_GRANT` returns to zero at that point. The previous
draw in this file was repaid the same way — by collapsing spent allocations into
a digest index, which recovered more than the grant.
