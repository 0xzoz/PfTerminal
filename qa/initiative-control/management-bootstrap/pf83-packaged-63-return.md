# RETURN — pf83-packaged-63

Round-67 correction: this is the historical round-63 return. The runbook now links the built package and its attestation; current package/pin status is recorded in `pf83-package-67/`. Historical round-63 test counts and missing-build observations below are not new round-67 results.

Action `pf83-packaged-63`; allocation digest `ee5c594ceac4c83cf95a18901d758caf9f5df16eb9619af48bc6693ab25ae0e6`; claim `6ba50ff7-38e5-4662-87e8-1252be170a93`; runtime `gpt-6-astra high`.
Brief read first; SHA-256 verified `a53813dc3d7cb4b67d49e84cb051a70d9aa8556be29a9df924b6dab347be0c01`. Initial clean HEAD/base `c2505dd1f4c9f7a34c58892a448a01992966c75e`, tree `76fefb07c6eaebaa751ae128402bebb688c43750`, worktree `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/pf83-rebind-20260916`.

Routine evidence/runbook correction supporting active `p0-security-levels.md` / `PF-83-S01` (`in_progress`). Product heading **Permission selection confirmation — TO BUILD**, excerpt “A submitted selection is not a confirmed change.” Used the Corbanu Terminal development skill and consulted the test-tui skill for the future PTY procedure. No Rust, production, test-source or snapshot edits; no formatter/fix tool was needed or run. No guest contact, code-blind execution, credentials read, live-profile use, subagent, commit or push. New independent design/execution is not applicable to this documentation-only increment; the existing packaged functional gate remains open, with no waiver or new integrator acceptance claimed.

## Corrected wording quoted in place

In [Picker and route navigation: what is native today](pf83-escalation-60-f10-f11-exit.md#picker-and-route-navigation-what-is-native-today):

> Key traversal is **per popup**: the picker-to-confirmation and picker-to-reasoning hops are re-injected by the fixture through popup-opening methods after reading emitted events, rather than driven end to end by keys. Of the nine reruns, **seven send keys at all**; `model_picker_same_slug_marks_only_exact_provider_current` is render-only, and `status_permissions_compact_next_turn_label_at_narrow_widths` is a status-label test.

The adjacent permission/model bullet descriptions now disclose fixture re-injection too. These are round-61 reruns; no nine-test navigation lane was rerun or newly claimed here.

In the same record's **F03** disposition:

> conditional mismatch visibility lacks server-grounded captured authority/lifecycle input and **REQUIRES separate authorization; it is NOT yet authorized or tracked**. There is no plan entry or sprint item for that residual. This is an unresolved requirement, not an approved deferral, and a busy flag does not prove it.

In the [production freeze](pf83-exit-61-production-freeze.md):

> The F03 captured-running-authority comparison **REQUIRES separate authorization and is NOT yet authorized or tracked**: there is no plan entry or sprint item for it, and this freeze does not approve its deferral;

## Runbook and refusal

[Packaged F05–F09 runbook](pf83-packaged-63-runbook.md) supplies the current source pin/four-file package recipe, host/guest identity checks, per-case environment and exact original headings, current harness/credential prerequisites, all 27 negative-control categories and 13 positives, write-once evidence paths, exact-byte sealing, and immediate stop conditions. It is coordinator-only and must not contaminate the blind executor with prior findings. [Case-input TSV](pf83-packaged-63-case-inputs.tsv) pins **288** source-informed packet paths in the F05–F09 projection of a many-to-many map (F05 8; F06 8; F07 16; F08 40; F09 216). `G03-FR`, `G03-RF`, `G12`/`G13`, and `G08`/`G17` also map to F04, F03, F02, and F10 respectively, as disclosed in the added `all_mapped_cases` column. These are not exclusive case ownership, replacements for the five originals, or executions.

The runbook records the scoped F04 refusal: “We take extra caution with cybersecurity requests. If you're a security professional, you may be able to apply for Trusted Access.” It concerned continuing/repeating the F04 post-Applied protected-write investigation. The receipt does not preserve the exact triggering prompt or separate refusals for F05–F09. Fable's later repetitions are not new independent executor acceptance.

F06–F09 have candid narrower **partial** usability/continuity attempts; acceptance by the refusing model is unknown. F05's central withheld-approval question cannot be removed without removing the case. No complete original case is cleared by reframing; behavioral probes, omitted branches and all isolation prerequisites remain explicit. No attempt or evasion was made.

## Required validation

Read `docs/development/test-isolation.md` before testing. From `codex-rs`, all commands used shared dedicated `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/targets/pf83-rebind-31`, `NEXTEST_TEST_THREADS=4`, `INSTA_UPDATE=no`. Prerequisites first: `cargo build --locked --offline -p codex-cli -p codex-rmcp-client -p codex-code-mode-host --bins`, exit **0**. Every test used this checkout's guarded `just test`, disposable profiles and native-keyring denial; no native credential prompt observed.

| Exact command after common environment | Run / pass / fail / skipped | Exit | Run ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `just test -p codex-app-server thread_settings --locked --offline --retries 0` | **26 / 26 / 0 / 1082** | 0 | `f1c2cd19-ec88-4144-a883-930b6eaa2a14` |
| `just test -p codex-tui permission_confirmation --locked --offline --retries 0` | **12 / 12 / 0 / 4161** | 0 | `15d844e6-96f3-4528-b946-dcea51c9461e` |

**38 tests passed; exact failure names: none.** No retries, zero-test lanes, leak classifications or timeouts. Compile warnings remain in raw logs. Ignored local logs beside this receipt are preserved:

## Changed lines and discrepancies

`pf83-escalation-60-f10-f11-exit.md` **+4/-4**; `pf83-exit-61-production-freeze.md` **+1/-1**; new runbook **+96**; new TSV **+289**; this return **+55**. Total **+445/-5 = 450 changed lines**, of which 289 are generated packet inventory. Raw ignored build/test logs: **1166 lines / 46110 bytes**, separate from these changes. All edited/created files are under the authorized QA prefix. Zero Rust lines changed.

Checks: `git diff --check` passed; **34/34** production freeze hashes match; **288/288** packet hashes and unique paths verified; original frozen case/copy hash matches; `python3 -B docs/sprints/check.py` passed (**115 current / 127 archived**). Final status contains only the five intended QA files; ignored logs use the same prefix. No new functional/human-ready/release claim.

Brief discrepancies: “only work left is the packaged run itself” overstates readiness. The current harness/package pins are stale, normalized packets are source-informed/stale, native dispatch is disabled and the service is preflight-only; fresh broker/isolation/launcher evidence is still required. Historical guest-staged subscription auth is not proof of current credential isolation and cannot be reused under this assignment. The exit record also admits native gaps (combined route-switch race, cancel/failure traversal, unanswered-approval full-authority pair, and F10 pending-application barrier); those do not vanish because this round is documentation-only. No current-freeze package hash exists in the supplied inputs, so the runbook specifies a successor build and marks hashes pending rather than inventing an artifact. The two requested wording corrections are supported by the inspected tree. The F04 refusal text is established by the manager receipt, not five separately observed case refusals.
