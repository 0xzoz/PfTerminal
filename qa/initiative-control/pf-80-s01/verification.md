# PF-80-S01 offline qualification and manager handoff

## Bounded follow-up to f7159c167 (2026-09-11)

The original qualification below is retained as historical evidence for
`f7159c16723f59d021f46c7b66fdb8401ac777e4`. Its 48-test result and statement about
multiple IDs did not cover repeated CLI options. The first independent helper
review reported two P2 blockers, both verified by the parent. Travis authorized
this bounded uncommitted fix; the parent owns the one post-fix structured review.

Repeated `--event-id` occurrences now fail during argument validation before
dispatch for every command, including retry. Tests cover different/same IDs,
invalid, empty, absent-value and missing-record first selections, equals syntax,
live arguments, unchanged single-ID dispatch and unsupported commands. Guards
assert no state reads/writes/locks/scans, credential access or transport calls on
rejected input, and synthetic state remains byte-identical.

Creation and immutable-event validation share the existing 300-character text
safety check plus the pinned 500 UTF-8-byte branch limit. Regressions cover ASCII
299/300/301 and 499/500/501 lengths (the stricter text bound remains), multibyte
499/500/501 byte lengths, the reported 187-character/547-byte example, unsafe
text, and hash-consistent persisted records. Validation never rewrites payloads.

Current checks: **81 tests passed** (54 focused, 5 plan, 22 sprint), no failures,
errors or skips. Appended exact command/output records are in `focused.log`,
`plans.log` and `sprints.log`; prior outputs are explicitly historical. Repository
checks passed: 3 active plans, 115 current and 121 archived sprints. Whitespace
checks passed. All 14 receiving hashes match and all 12 original source hashes
are preserved. The delivery merge contract now binds the current tooling digest
and appended evidence; its check is mechanical and does not establish review,
enablement or human acceptance. No reviewer/model/extra agent was invoked for
this implementation follow-up. The full-index patch hash is reported at handoff
outside this patch to avoid a self-referential hash.

The Corbanu development skill kept this fix within the existing PF-80 plan and
in-progress PF-80-S01 sprint; shared manager ledgers were not changed. All original
live, human, native runtime, deployment and release limitations below still apply.

## Original port qualification (historical)

Status: **in progress / awaiting independent manager review**. No sprint
completion, deployment, enablement, TaskNode delivery or release is claimed.
Change class: product initiative. Product citation: **Internal delivery control
— TO BUILD**, “Use sequential sprints per initiative”. The
`corbanu-terminal-development` skill routed this work through the existing
PF-80 plan/sprint and their exact write boundary; manager retains shared ledgers.

## Candidate and provenance

- Worktree: `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/tasknode-pf80-s01-20260911`.
- Branch: `workstream/tasknode-pf80-s01-20260911`.
- Verified clean launch HEAD: `f17e5a54daba11c6da2554f14b62f11ace752142`.
- The plan/sprint record retains the manager's original allocation base
  `295aed26e53b17f919f7199ae1c9748b1b1250ba`; the launch authorization explicitly
  supplied the later merged HEAD. No shared record was changed by this worker.
- Source: only 12 named files from the read-only recovery tooling directory;
  `__pycache__` excluded. Seven files remain byte-identical and five changed.
  Two receiving files add 15 tests and a synthetic historical fixture.
- `source-port-manifest.json` records each source and receiving SHA-256 and
  audit/change rationale. Recovery scripts were **untracked** under checkout
  HEAD `6f8f4ce46446e951437e1ce7e7c4a526e5b9e546`; hashes, not that commit alone,
  identify the port. `native-source-pins.json` records inspected native contracts.
- Final implementation identity is the receiving hashes in the manifest and
  the local commit reported at handoff. No remote pull, push or merge was run.

## Actual verification

Runtime: Python 3.14.4, macOS 26.6.2 arm64. Disposable ignored venv:
`qa/initiative-control/pf-80-s01/.venv-v0D0As`, installed only
`markdown-it-py==3.0.0` and `mdurl==0.1.2` from pinned requirements.
No dependency or lockfile outside scope changed. System Python initially lacked
markdown-it-py; the pinned venv resolved that prerequisite.

| Check | Actual result | Exact output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unmodified recovery tooling on receiving tree | 33 tests passed, 0 failures/errors/skips, 0.202s | `baseline-focused.log` |
| Final receiving focused suite | 48 tests passed, 0 failures/errors/skips, 2.315s | `focused.log` |
| Plan governance regression suite | 5 tests passed, 0 failures/errors/skips, 0.018s | `plans.log` |
| Sprint governance regression suite | 22 tests passed, 0 failures/errors/skips, 0.040s | `sprints.log` |
| Plan repository check | Pass: active 3/3, available slots 0 | `plans.log` |
| Sprint repository check | Pass: current 115, archived 121 | `sprints.log` |
| Pinned first-party `validateEvent` | 2 synthetic goal payloads accepted, identities/task lists retained | `pinned-contract.log` |
| Internal delivery merge-evidence check | Pass, `release_authorized: false`; independent review pending | `delivery-merge.log` |
| Source provenance / literal write scope / whitespace | Pass, 12 source + 14 receiving file hashes; no native or shared edits | `scope.log` |

Final unittest count: **75** (48 focused + 5 plan + 22 sprint); baseline 33 is
separate historical-in-this-run evidence, not another final suite. Focused logs
include installer/timer wording printed by an inherited fixture: service calls
were mocked and directories synthetic. No actual service was activated.

`delivery-merge-contract.json` pins all 14 receiving tooling/fixture files and
the OFF/compatibility artifacts. Its successful mechanical check is builder
evidence for manager review, not independent acceptance or an enablement gate.

Commands, from the worker root (prefix Python commands with
`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`):

```sh
qa/initiative-control/pf-80-s01/.venv-v0D0As/bin/python -m unittest discover -s scripts/initiative_control -p 'test_*.py' -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s docs/plans/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s docs/sprints/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
python3 docs/plans/check.py
python3 docs/sprints/check.py
git diff --check
git diff --cached --check
```

The pinned validator probe imports only `server/campaign-tracker-contract.js`
at the recorded TaskNode source path. It passes two events generated by the
receiving `tasknode.event_for`: synthetic PF-80 and historical PF-76, workspace
`synthetic-workspace`, task `synthetic-task`, sequences 0 and 1. It asserts ID,
kind and task-list equality after validation. No routes, auth, DB, entitlement
request or remote API was invoked. This proves payload shape, not delivery.

## What the evidence establishes

Preparation selects one immutable ID from a 25-event queue and preserves every
state byte. Missing/invalid/multiple IDs fail; an unrelated malformed record is
not scanned. Both CLI aliases reject live flags and credential/report paths.
`flush --event-id` fails before credential loading. Local enablement and a
workspace receipt cannot turn preparation into a send authorization.

Changed payload hashes fail before preview or transport. Invalid/unsafe reports,
extra raw fields, stale observations, wrong workspace, changed mappings,
duplicate sends, timeout/backoff, wrong response ID and HTTP 401/403/409 are
covered offline. The HTTP statuses stand in for expiry/ownership/conflict;
they do not prove live account behavior. Disabled restart preserves queue data
and cannot load credentials or call flush. Preview never resets attempts or
delivered/blocked status.

Twenty-five synthetic historical PF-76 records remain byte-identical under
prepare, refused enqueue/retry and a mocked enabled batch flush. The receiving
publication test exports main's actual documents/checkers, holds ambiguous
PF-76 reports outside provider joins, displays only the new PF-80 run, preserves
both raw reports, and retains last-good publication after source corruption.
Malformed/failed rendering and unsafe Markdown have inherited regression tests.

## Manager review and integration

Only these prefixes are written: `scripts/initiative_control/`,
`docs/research/tasknode-integration/`, `qa/initiative-control/pf-80-s01/`.
Review the source manifest before judging the large mechanical port diff.
Independent review was not invoked: the manager owns it, per launch scope.

The smallest next decision is to accept or request changes to this offline
port and conservative PF-76 history hold. Then the manager owns CI/source-sync
registration and combined-tree tests, and can allocate the bounded native
single-event transport described in the research note. The exporter retains
its existing flat tooling allowlist: the new nested synthetic fixture is not
part of a runtime export; test the receiving checkout, not a deployment export.
Shared `docs/plans/feature-delivery.md` still says the tooling is not yet ported;
the manager should update that status only after integration review.

Manager update during execution: remote main now has kickoff receipt
`7bb0697cf8a5e88fc50bc232b65fea8d77f6da4a` after the launch base. Worker did not
pull. Manager reports GitHub Actions jobs did not start because the account is
locked by a billing issue. No workflow edits/retries were made; remote CI is
unqualified. Manager must rerun against the combined tree when CI is available.

## Remaining gates and limits

No live state inventory, credential access, enrollment, signing, permission
grant, task create/accept/submit, progress post, server deployment, beta branch
or release occurred. Posting stays OFF. The historical live batch remains
pending by manager report, with unverified enrollment and no delivery; its
actual count/bytes were not read. See the concrete cutover plan in research.

The existing Python batch sender is retained for compatibility; a native
single-event sender is still missing. Workspace-only enrollment receipts do
not establish current account identity or entitlement. Pattern-based redaction
cannot detect all private text. A native transport allocation, supported target
lifecycle, scoped operator authority, exact first payload, current enrollment
and entitlement, private destination visibility, and named-human acceptance
remain required before any first-live-event qualification.

Actual-key TUI: not applicable to this slice because no Rust, native interactive
path or native UI changed. A later native transport/UI change needs its own
TUI evidence. Browser visual/human dashboard acceptance remains pending; local
HTTP and publication tests are not a visual acceptance claim. TensorCash and
Isometric Game: not applicable to internal document projection under the plan.
Benchmarks/release: not run; no runtime performance change or release readiness
claimed. PF-79 remains dependent and not ready; PF13 is untouched.
