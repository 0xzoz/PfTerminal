# Current workstream handoffs — September 12

## September 20 19:15 UTC — build for human testing installed

- The launcher's stable links now point at a build of integration commit
  `3882e39d5`, built from a clean detached checkout of that exact commit. Two
  packages were produced: the distribution-clean one from the canonical builder,
  and a developer-accounting one with collection compiled in. Both are signed
  with the same Developer ID and identifiers, so Keychain and TCC identity are
  unchanged, and either can be selected with a one-line script.
- **The shortcut opens the developer-accounting package**, at Travis's explicit
  request to be able to test the feature. The package builder still refuses any
  marked input, so this cannot become a shipped binary.
- Two gates would otherwise read as defects and are now stated on the dashboard:
  collection activates only for provider ids `openai` and `anthropic` - the
  lane's own test asserts `claude-plan` is excluded - and the ledger installs
  itself on first use, so an empty inspector right after switching is expected.
- The human test queue was rewritten against this build; the older entries had
  described work from 14-17 September. See
  [the testing note](human-testing-20260920.md).

## September 15 19:40 UTC — isolation executed, two units received

- **Security** ([PF-83-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-83-s01-permission-confirmation.md)):
  the network blocker is **closed**. Travis supplied an administrator credential
  through the vault and the manager executed the isolation directly: Tailscale
  logged out and disconnected, default-deny `pf` leaving only inbound SSH from
  the host and its reply path, DHCP and host ICMP, restored at boot by a
  LaunchDaemon. Verified after a reboot with 839 packets proven dropped by the
  block rule, because `pflog0` does not exist on this build and a counter proves
  more than a timeout. The mediated pinhole is **deliberately absent**: it was
  opened on 8111 and Docker already held that port on the host, so the rule
  pointed the guest at an unrelated published port. Sealed is correct until a
  real mediator exists. [Receipt](../management-bootstrap/pf83-isolation-executed-20260915.md).
  Decision `pf83-network-isolation-20260915` is **resolved**; the dashboard is
  down to one open question. No case has run and all 380 verdicts stay
  `not_reached` until the preflight re-run and a separate execution decision.
- **Accounting** ([PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md)):
  direct Chat received at `82f9dde0e`, cleanup at `533a16077`, ledgers
  reconciled, and an authoritative receiving disposition now names every
  attempt and whose fault each stop was — four of the six stops were the
  manager's. The [closure assessment](../../../docs/research/agent-cost-accounting/s02-closure-assessment-20260915.md)
  recommends closing bounded S02 rather than adding another collector; closure
  itself is a separate decision that has not been taken.
- **Task Node** ([PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md)):
  owner-daemon increment D received at `aba3707b0` after five review rounds.
  Its [functional case design](../management-bootstrap/owner-daemon-functional-design-20260915.md)
  is frozen with 18 offline cases; the harness has 6 built and 12 correctly
  refused for lack of working negative controls, which is being finished now.
- **Known gap:** the evidenced Slack alert path is still refused because the
  transport verification window expired, and re-qualification needs owner UI
  evidence plus a gap review for three uncovered ingress marks. See
  [the request](../management-bootstrap/slack-requalification-20260915.md).
  Reaching Travis is not blocked; only the receipted path is.

## September 15 14:40 UTC — unattended manager session

Fable ran the review to receive to dispatch loop unattended on Opus 5.0 High.

- **Task Node** ([PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md)):
  threaded decision answers are **received at `4c501b710`** and pushed. Two
  designs were rejected before this one; both are retained. The accepted design
  gives every alert its own root thread and posts one fixed-text pointer into
  the parent thread, so ingress attribution never consults follower state. The
  independent review found a P2 (a pre-admission gate refusal was written as a
  terminal `uncertain` although no POST was attempted, leaving a slot that
  `send` would not retry and `reconcile` could not resolve) and a P3 (an
  undocumented `message_mention` field); both were corrected in `e430763bb`
  with five regressions proven to fail against the previous commit. Disclosed
  and open: a refused slot returns to `pending` but surfaces no signal, so only
  an operator re-running `send` moves it.
- **Accounting** ([PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md)):
  the direct Chat Completions unit is frozen, published and dispatched. Three
  workers **correctly STOPPED** before finishing and each was right: two named
  unreconciled dispatch prerequisites (fixed in `d7cd95e16`, `155b0c1a9` and
  `3e04c4e52`, including the exclusive lease `acct-chat-20260915`), and the
  third stopped on a real contract conflict — the frozen design expects
  continuation after a length finish while Core terminates without further
  model work. **Manager disposition: production behaviour wins**; the
  expectation is corrected and the counterexample preserved. `acct-chat-impl-04`
  is running on that disposition plus a compile failure, four failures, two
  LEAK markers and three owed mutation demonstrations.
- **Security** ([PF-83-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-83-s01-permission-confirmation.md)):
  still **blocked on network isolation**, which is a Travis decision. The
  preflight receipt is accepted as an honest result, not a passing gate: 2
  proven, 173 of 175 controls UNPROVEN, all 380 verdicts `not_reached`. No case
  will run while the guest reaches the internet.
- **Slack**: the receiver crashed at 12:22 UTC; three inbound callbacks were
  fenced but never recorded. It was restarted and the gap is disclosed rather
  than papered over. A password posted in the channel is treated as exposed: it
  was never used, never stored, and rotation was requested. Key-based access to
  the guest already exists and is sufficient.

## September 15 19:00 UTC — second unattended session

- **Accounting** ([PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md)):
  the direct Chat Completions unit is **received at `82f9dde0e`** and its
  disclosed-debt cleanup at `533a16077`. Five workers were dispatched to get
  there and three of them **correctly STOPPED**: twice because the manager had
  not reconciled the dispatch prerequisites, once on a real contract conflict
  where the frozen design expected continuation after a length finish while
  Core terminates. Production behaviour won and the counterexample is kept.
  The cleanup closed six leaky fixtures, the per-frame provider-check lag and
  a dishonest builder signature. Two further worker stops were caused by
  manager scope errors, recorded as such rather than blamed on the workers.
- **Task Node** ([PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md)):
  threaded decision answers received at `4c501b710`, then owner-daemon
  **increment D received at `aba3707b0`** after five review rounds. Increment D
  exists because of a real incident this session: the Slack listener died at
  12:22 UTC, the supervisor saw the exit and only stopped, nothing restarted or
  recorded it, and it stayed dead about two hours while the fence ran three
  marks ahead of recorded ingress with nothing surfacing the gap. Review found
  and closed two P2s and six P3s along the way, including a watchdog that could
  die from lock contention, a supervisor that contended with the callback lock
  and could cause the very gap it discloses, and a fix that fsync-rewrote its
  status file ten times a second. Final review: zero findings, confidence 0.82.
  Recurrence stays **OFF**.
- **Security** ([PF-83-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-83-s01-permission-confirmation.md)):
  still gated on Travis, but the question is now much sharper. Inspecting the
  guest to write the execution brief found **Tailscale connected on it**, a
  second default route through `utun6`. A packet filter on `en0` alone would
  have looked enforced without being enforced, which is the worst available
  outcome and is a plausible reason the preflight reached the internet. The
  [execution brief](../management-bootstrap/pf83-isolation-execution-20260915.md)
  removes that path first, then installs default-deny with two exceptions, with
  a dead-man revert, boot persistence and a post-reboot verification matrix.

## September 14 correction — overnight Keychain prompts

The first PF-83 verification run inherited the live Corbanu home and generated
100 native-Keychain prompt requests from separate test app-server processes.
The earlier “unlock the Mac” explanation below is incomplete and must not be
used as a recovery instruction. Preserve the contaminated run, stop unsafe
retries, and use [the guarded test procedure](../../../docs/development/test-isolation.md).
[Repair scope and qualification](../../reliability/test-keychain-isolation-20260914.md)
do not close PF-83's separate functional gate or resume paused product work.

## Management takeover — September 14 01:40 UTC (Fable 5.1 High)

Fable took over management/integration under the authorized PF-80-S01 bootstrap
per the takeover brief (root `fableMarkdown.md`) at `c0d5b38fd`, which matched
`origin/integrate/management-workstreams-20260911`. Recorded as coordinator event
`takeover:fable-manager-20260914T0140Z` (revision 373). Actual state inspected,
not replayed: coordinator `enabled: false`, no manager run, 19 meaningful events
pending; both monitors PAUSED; decision feed revision 32 with all five decisions
resolved; supervised Slack listener still alive against the operator store
(journal `held`, last verified 2026-09-13T22:55:59Z, one agent ACK); dashboard
on `127.0.0.1:8769` is the RPC SSH forward serving stale `build-mppqf3at`
(source `239f7f82`, feed revision 30). This host exposes no native subagents;
workers run as TMUX Corbanu sessions.

- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): active. Next owned actions: one Luna Extra High republication of this commit; close [DEC-001 provenance limits](../management-bootstrap/supervised-qualification-20260913.md); allocate a new Slack receiver and the next frozen DEC/SLK cases; qualify handoff/stall/restart paths before any recurring activation.
- [PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): intentional pause (product resumption gate). Remaining ledger: non-Anthropic dispatch coverage; S03 dependent; collection OFF.
- [PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): intentional pause (product resumption gate). Remaining: native/all-platform and independently isolated functional acceptance; PF-35-S01 dataset generation via DeepSeek API through Corbanu Terminal.

Product resumption, recurring activation, Task Node posting and public beta
remain separately gated. Older sections below are historical.

### Update — September 14 04:45 UTC: accounting gate opened; cycle 2 dispatched

Travis directly authorized opening the **accounting** product-resumption gate;
**security resumes only after the isolated executor is qualified.** Recorded as
decision `accounting-product-resumption` (raised/resolved, feed revision 33) and
coordinator stream mode `accounting: enabled` (revision 388). Dashboard was
republished at `005cc644f` as `build-emg07z3v` (feed 32, 0 open; receipt
`publication-one-shot-20260914T041440Z`). Fresh Fable decision runs
`d36611fa…` and `dc371dd6…` accepted three actions, each dispatched to an Astra
High TMUX session that returned the exact allocation-digest ACK:

- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md) `dec001-provenance-closeout-01` (implement, private harness repo, 90 min): close the five DEC-001 provenance receipts and review02 follow-ups; no live replay.
- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md) `slack-receiver-02` (evidence_review, ACK-only, tools disabled): live receiver for future human replies, replacing closed `01a09c75`.
- [PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md) `responses-dispatch-design-01` (design, read-only goldens checkout, 60 min): allocation proposal for Responses HTTP dispatch coverage; manager accepts/adjusts before any source dispatch.

One fresh-manager attempt (`eee2a820…`) was held at `briefing_size_hold`
(70,371 B at one event vs 65,536) and failed explicitly; eight consumed
historical allocations were compacted via `put_allocation(replace)` with frozen
originals retained in the audit table. No inference ran for that attempt.
[PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md) stays intentionally paused by that decision.

### Update — September 14 09:45 UTC: overnight cycles 3–8

Travis approved unattended recurrence (activation still gated on qualification),
`--yolo` for non-test workers, and security relaunch once workstream 3 is done.

- [PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): Responses HTTP dispatch allocation frozen (`25920ec8d`), governance reconciled after a correct worker preflight STOP (`c7ee093bc`); implementation `e47e41870` (20 files, 2871/1054 lines, 385/385 focused; two frozen role cases reframed because a role cannot override the reserved built-in `openai` provider) reviewed clean (0 findings) and **received at `d81bad635`**: combined 634/634, Core accounting 63/63. Collection OFF; WS/Chat/auxiliary routes remain open.
- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): DEC-001 harness hardened (`7ce49a7` → P2 fixed `ebe0bd7`, corrective review clean), fresh attested fixture from a detached candidate worktree (`4713c31`), replay `attempt-waid23v9` raw pass with **independent evidence review "supported with limits"** (all five prior provenance gaps evidenced; residual: image consumption not attested, provider HTTP uncapturable). Briefing-size defect fixed and received (`da456599d`, 494 tests) plus preview follow-up (`82dda1ad2`, 496 tests). Multi-case harness `00ef50f` reviewed correct; DEC-021 marked unmapped (vacuous secret variant, P2) with DEC-003/026; two executor-found defects fixed by the manager (write-once receipt collisions → checkpoints `2761743`; venv interpreter). DEC-002 passed on `3ffeac0`; the remaining 21 mapped cases are executing sequentially with retained failures.
- **Competing writer**: `fix/live-permission-transition-20260913` (new sprint PF-83-S01 under the security plan, created by another agent) was merged into integration as `a51602037` outside the integration gate and carried to origin by a manager push before detection. Its only known review is "patch is incorrect" (pre-commit tree). Not reverted; treated as unverified; question `pf83-external-integration` sent to Slack (thread `1789375985.333669`) after a recorded outage-gap review re-qualified the transport. Default if unanswered: keep + Rust verification, revert on failure.
- Slack receiver `slack-receiver-02` alive (session `01a09e29…`); listener journal re-qualified 08:52Z.

### Update — September 14 12:50 UTC: overnight cycles 9–15 (Travis signed off ~08:40Z)

Authority recorded: unattended recurrence approved pending qualification;
`--yolo` for non-test workers; security relaunch once workstream 3 completes.

- **DEC functional cases**: 18 independently supported (001, 002, 004–019 less
  003), DEC-025 retained as a genuine product/UX finding, DEC-020/022/023/024
  blocked by the pinned guest's ~20-action budget, DEC-003/021/026 unmapped.
  Record: [supervised-execution-20260914](../management-bootstrap/supervised-execution-20260914.md).
  Harness lineage through `714cb08`; every executor-found defect fixed and reviewed.
- **Restart/stall/crash rehearsal** with real TMUX workers: crashed worker and
  uncertain dispatch both flagged by `watchdog` and reconciled `failed` without
  relaunch; receiver kept on inspection. Recorded in the same document.
- **Owner daemon**: design accepted (`owner-daemon-design-01`); increment A
  kernel `48f340767` reviewed correct (P3 temp-dir) and **received at
  `bcec9862f`** (514 tests). Default OFF; live TMUX transport is increment B
  (allocated). Recurrence is **not** activated; no Slack activation notice sent.
- **SLK harness**: design accepted (14 offline cases, 4 live-no-human, SLK-009
  needs Travis, SLK-006 deferred); increment 1 `c030e7f` in the private repo
  (packaging, synthetic fixtures, dry diagnostics for five cases) accepted as a
  bounded partial; increment 2 allocated with an integrator-recorded +800 lines.
- **PF-83 external merge**: first Rust verification was invalid — my session's
  `CODEX_HOME` leaked into spawned app-servers (real home read; 543 v2 failures);
  retained as contaminated, rerun with home variables unset in progress. The
  Slack question `pf83-external-integration` remains open.
- **Blockers needing Travis**: (1) `git push` blocked — login keychain locked, so
  origin stays at `f26ce7daa` while local integration is ahead; (2) Claude
  provider (`claude-plan`) unresponsive from ~12:10Z: fresh Fable decisions and
  independent reviews are paused; a bounded retry loop is running; OpenAI
  workers unaffected. Nothing was pushed to main; no credentials were entered.

### Update — September 14 21:30 UTC: relaunched host, afternoon cycles

Corrections: the overnight "locked keychain" framing was wrong — test app-servers
inherited the live profile (repair `3ab6aa051`); both overnight PF-83 runs stay
contaminated. Since the relaunch (rebuilt host 0.1.42; worker pin unchanged):

- **PF-83 external merge**: guarded `just test` on the tip plus a pre-merge
  baseline (`da456599d` + isolation harness, isolated build dir): app-server
  0 tip-only failures (11 vs 13), TUI 4 tip-only all flaky on rerun, PF-83 area
  tests 15/15. No attributable regression. Travis answered in Slack
  (`Ev0C1N1SCT53`): keep and incorporate, fix the two P2s. Feed rev 36
  resolved; PF-83 functional gate remains open for its owner.
- **Slack**: the supervised listener child had been a zombie since ~10:16Z
  (PID-only liveness checks missed it); replaced by a manager-owned supervised
  listener (operator2, FIFO ops), re-qualified with gap reviews twice (one
  self-inflicted supervisor bug, patched). **SLK-009 re-run completed**: fresh
  ACK-only question, Travis ACK admitted live, interpreted, handoff delivered to
  `slack-receiver-02` with exact `expected_ack`, feed rev 38 resolved,
  acknowledged notice posted. Limit: the native `Bridge` evidence contract was
  bypassed for the TMUX receiver (owner-daemon increment C input).
- **DEC-025 fix** (Travis: fix now): `d71a8ef14` → `7a8ff466a` → `2aac8f840`,
  all reviewed/received (`fcbc2ad31`, `d8d8e3516`, `a9801395b`); harness
  re-pinned per candidate (v2–v4). On v4: DEC-002 ✓, DEC-005 ✓, DEC-025 ✓;
  DEC-001 fails on the synthetic summary's wording (passed twice on v1 with the
  same text) — under independent adjudication, not treated as a regression.
- **Owner daemon**: increment B received (`e8d99d4cb`) after a corrective
  review (two transport races fixed, 539 tests). Recurrence still not activated.
- **SLK harness**: increments 2–3 corrected P1/P2 findings; increment 4 (SLK-013
  expectation, traceback retention, ceiling citation 1987) dispatched.
- Dashboard `build-uflvf0tt` @ `a826527bb`; integration tip `a9801395b` == origin.

### Update — September 15 00:15 UTC: Task Node records landed; model switch to Opus 5.0 High

Travis (chat): accepted all three Task Node coordination tasks and asked for the
work they describe; then, citing quota, directed that after this round every use
of Fable 5.1 High (independent reviews, evidence reviews, the fresh-manager loop)
move to **Opus 5.0 High** (`claude-opus-5-plan`, provider `claude-plan`, effort
`high`) and that this round be merged onto integration and pushed.

- **Task Node** ([PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md)):
  acceptance receipt [tasknode-acceptance-20260914](../management-bootstrap/tasknode-acceptance-20260914.md)
  (three off-chain `accepted` lifecycle events, CLI statuses, JSON digests).
  Guarded single-event transport `c37d68969` reviewed (correct, two P3 follow-ups:
  `flush` must skip intent-bearing events before any batch enablement; add a
  `send`→`post` idempotency wiring test) and received at `5c2cfc04b`. Posting OFF;
  no activation file exists.
- **Workstream records** (each reviewed by Opus 5.0 High as a truthfulness audit,
  all hashes/links verified, "Human review and approval" left blank for Travis):
  PF-13 security `ccac81090` → `08a5b105b`; PF-60 accounting `2de349bcd` →
  `56410b5aa` (P3: row-29 "stale" wording is an author disposition, flagged for
  Travis); PF-80 status packet `5d4089851` + owner receipt fix `ad000956c` →
  `677e970cd`. Next: Travis reads each document and fills the approval block;
  only then a guarded dry-run, then one `--live` evidence submission per task.
- **Security** ([PF-83-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-83-s01-permission-confirmation.md)):
  both P2s were already fixed in the merged tip; `4fd27d0b6` adds real-dispatch
  regression coverage (guarded focused TUI 9/9; three pre-existing broader
  failures documented, incl. version snapshot 0.1.38 vs 0.1.42), reviewed
  (correct, 1 P3) and received at `02abee2ec`. Independent functional gate still
  open. PF-27-S04 successor design accepted (revoke idle broker channels on
  generation cancellation; reconcile `c51d2d6aa` receiving receipt); dispatch
  waits for PF-83-S01 closure and PF-27-S04 re-reservation.
- **Accounting** ([PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md)):
  next-unit design accepted — Responses **WebSocket sampling** (18 files, 36
  tests, 3000/1050 target, 3300/1200 stop; reuses the accepted decoder and
  price snapshots; startup prewarm explicitly outside scope; Chat deferred with
  cited reasons). Next: freeze the allocation document, reconcile plan/sprint,
  dispatch implementation.
- **SLK harness** increment 4 (`f97406f`) reviewed correct (1 P3: readiness read
  lacks OSError retry); offline runs are scripted-actor only — code-blind actor
  wiring is next.
- **Model switch** landed at `76efe32eb` ([record](../management-bootstrap/model-switch-opus5-20260914.md)):
  `fable_launcher.MODEL = claude-opus-5-plan`; Python suite green under the
  receiving tree. The first live decision cycle on the new model qualifies it.
  Review wrappers now pass `--model claude-opus-5-plan`.
- **Briefing size**: two `briefing_size_hold` runs failed explicitly; resolved by
  compacting consumed allocations and moving long record briefs into frozen
  digest-checked private files. Structural growth (36 consumed allocations,
  ~2 KB per retained terminal action) remains a delivery follow-up.
- Dispatch defect fixed: worker START must be re-sent until the pane shows
  `Working (`; the dispatch helper now verifies that.

### Update — September 15 12:50 UTC: PF-83 preflight ran; Bridge bypass closed; two designs rejected on review

- **Security** ([PF-83-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-83-s01-permission-confirmation.md)):
  the gate is now real machinery running against a real guest. Travis provisioned
  a macOS 26.2 arm64 VM and then a clean `agent` account (uid 503, not in
  `admin`, no sudo, empty home) after the first account was **refused** for
  carrying live agent credentials. `BoundaryWire` now runs over key-authenticated
  SSH with its framing and checks unchanged, the package is pinned by the proven
  cargo lane (`corbanu 0.1.42`, binary SHA-256 `3e99a6cb…`, mismatched manifest
  refused), and `tmux 3.7c` passed the PTY probe. **The authoritative preflight
  ran: 2 proven, 173 of 175 controls UNPROVEN.** Both the bridge and its child
  reached github.com and the host on port 22, so network denial is unenforced and
  no case may run. All 380 verdicts remain `not_reached`. Open decision
  `pf83-network-isolation-20260915`. Two manager-owned blockers were cleared
  along the way: the build lane was wrong (`just build-for-release` is a
  six-platform Bazel filegroup) and two `~/.cache` Bazel symlinks on this host
  were broken, failing every Bazel invocation at startup.
- **Task Node** ([PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md)):
  the **Slack Bridge evidence bypass is closed and received at `2ca10a43e`**. A
  TMUX receiver is now a first-class evidenced transport requiring its original
  in-memory witness, unchanged rollout and capture bytes, matching identity, an
  unconsumed nonce and bounded freshness — the manual pane-reading I had been
  relying on for real handoffs is no longer how this works. Three review rounds
  were needed: the transport itself, then real-world brickability (an ordinary
  mid-append rollout read or a slow model turn permanently bricked a handoff),
  then a budget-reserve gap that could start a durable attempt with no room left
  to collect the ACK.
- **Slack status** was wedged at `held` all session by an unreconcilable post
  record — the residue of a malformed attempt id I created. The guard now
  validates attempts before any durable write, the live orphan was reconciled as
  never-sent against read-only inspection evidence, and a **second copy of the
  same predicate** in the published projection (which is what the dashboard
  actually reads) had to be fixed too. The status is finally clear.

**Two designs were rejected on review rather than patched:**

- Shared-thread Slack posting failed twice — first silently misattributing a
  human reply to the wrong decision, then making a terminally failed follower
  deadlock the entire thread so even the parent question became unanswerable.
  After the second failure the approach was abandoned rather than iterated:
  every decision keeps its own thread, and a follow-up posts a fixed-text
  pointer notice into the thread it answers.
- The briefing ceiling was being met by hand-trimming context, which made
  briefings worse to make them smaller. Travis granted 10 KiB; the real cost was
  found instead (65 spent allocation stubs repeating placeholder objects,
  14.5 KB), collapsed into a digest index for a 10.7 KB saving, and **the grant
  was handed back the same day**.

### Update — September 15 10:10 UTC: accounting vectors closed, daemon qualified unassisted, security waiting on Travis

- **Accounting** ([PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md)):
  both previously partially-proven native vectors are **closed and received at
  `16c43b5fe`**. A stage-one binding injected into an *already-running* combined
  WS dispatch now stops it, and the native fixture emits the full safety /
  model-verification / moderation matrix across 72 combinations. Every claim is
  mutation-proven — guard bypass (`b530eb42`) and slot replacement (`5578019c`)
  each failed with their exact named assertions before the mutations were removed.
  Getting there took two recorded manager decisions, both triggered by the worker
  correctly refusing to act alone: a deliberate widening to 20 paths, and a
  bounded size-ceiling extension to 3700/1350 after it stopped 6 lines under the
  frozen 3300 limit. Two non-blocking P3s are recorded as disclosed follow-ups
  rather than dropped. Collection stays **OFF**.
- **Task Node** ([PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md)):
  the owner daemon now runs a live tick **unassisted**. The launch path writes a
  private `config.toml` and passes startup overrides, so a worker reaches a
  working state with no human clearing update/trust prompts — with sandbox,
  approval policy and prompt refusals unchanged. That also let the expired-lease
  case be re-proven properly: PID 20423 was actively running `/bin/sleep 300`
  when its real 180-second lease expired, giving `lease_expired` with a surviving
  PID, HOLD and exactly one launch. Reviewed clean (0 findings) and received.
  **Recurrence is still OFF**: independent confined functional acceptance and
  Slack/recurring-supervision qualification remain, so activation is not yet
  proposable.
- **Security** ([PF-83-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-83-s01-permission-confirmation.md)):
  **waiting on Travis.** The code-blind gate needs a genuinely isolated macOS
  environment (disposable VM, or a dedicated synthetic account with enforced
  filesystem / process / IPC / network / Keychain isolation). The manager cannot
  provision either — no passwordless `sudo` — and will not run the executor
  without the boundary, because the isolated-execution contract already rejects
  that evidence. Open decision `pf83-isolation-provisioning-20260915`. Meanwhile
  everything not needing the environment advanced: package verification (an
  altered manifest hash is refused), a bounded PTY protocol client, journaling and
  sealing, preflight validation and fault/MCP helpers. The preflight honestly
  reports all 175 controls **UNPROVEN**. A second blocker — the Bazel Rust target
  failing under Bazel 9.0.0, so no package can be pinned — is manager-owned and
  open. All 380 cases remain `not_reached`.

Two more manager-side process defects were found and fixed:

- A receive was recorded `verification_failed` even though the merge and all four
  gates passed, because the manager committed a doc-only change to the receiving
  branch while the gate was still running and the HEAD-unchanged check failed.
  One integration writer means no manager commits during an in-flight receive.
  Reconciled explicitly with the original receipt retained.
- Worker dispatch now refuses to launch when the worktree HEAD does not equal the
  assigned base, after a worker correctly stopped on exactly that divergence.

### Update — September 15 08:05 UTC: WS accounting, owner daemon C and the PF-83 harness all received

Three units landed in one goal-mode session, each reviewed by Opus 5.0 High and
corrected before receiving.

- **Accounting** ([PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md)):
  the Responses **WebSocket sampling unit is received at `c86634e21`** — 18 files,
  2831 total / 841 non-test lines (target 3000/1050), all 36 named cases. Review
  found one real gap: the redirect-latch case passed identically with the latch
  arm deleted, so it proved nothing. Closed in `50382ef13` by a mutation
  experiment — arm removed, case fails with the exact expected message (run
  `d4d6c364`, exit 100); arm restored, passes across all ten vectors (run
  `cccb60ec`). Receiving gates on the merged tree: codex-api 224/224, WS native
  20/20, Core accounting 35/35, state + TaskNode-session 390/390, responses proxy
  28/28. Two native vectors remain honestly disclosed as partially proven.
  Collection stays **OFF**. Two earlier attempts stopped correctly before
  touching code (missing build lease; base divergence) and both receipts are kept.
- **Task Node** ([PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md)):
  **owner daemon increment C received at `95b4d339a`** — a tick now carries
  prepared work through the real worker lifecycle (claim → TMUX launch → exact
  ACK digest compare → START with mandatory working verification → RETURN → record).
  Review caught a P2 that would have wedged the daemon permanently: any
  non-worker action kind (a prepared `wait`, `integrate`, `complete_sprint` …)
  hit `unsupported_worker_kind` and left an unresolvable hold, so every later
  tick returned HOLD forever. Corrected with named regressions, plus two P3s
  (pause before any effect now defers instead of fencing; a worker that dies
  right after emitting RETURN still has its durable evidence recorded). Suite
  591 green. The daemon stays **OFF** with no activation record.
- **Security** ([PF-83-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-83-s01-permission-confirmation.md)):
  functional-gate **harness increment 1 received at `4b85ffd98`** (harness lives
  outside the repo at `.codex-work/functional-pf83.20260915`). The design manifest
  is normalized to the expanded ID set so the schema-2 handoff checker can pass,
  with the original F01–F11 bytes preserved. Review found the loopback denial
  probes were invalid controls (a refused connection to a port with no listener)
  yet were feeding an `os-enforced` claim; they are removed and loopback is now
  recorded as explicitly **UNPROVEN**. The reserved 8-call tail is wired and
  proven end to end. Every functional verdict is still `not_reached`.

Two manager-side defects were found and fixed rather than worked around:

- Manager cycles were failing `briefing_size_hold` on every attempt. Compacted
  terminal actions still inlined their frozen 18-path manifests; those are now
  omitted with their digest retained (`8f3381ca3`). A second change that filtered
  "already visible" digests out of `evidence_omissions` was **reverted**
  (`d0d93c75a`) — `manager_cycle_test.BriefingSizeTests` encodes that the list
  reports what the manager *cannot read*, and the ~2.5 KB saving was not worth
  weakening that meaning.
- Receiving verification ran under the default macOS `TMPDIR`, exceeding the
  104-byte Unix socket limit and failing 27 daemon cases with
  `socket_path_too_long` on code the worker had seen green. Receiving commands
  now pin `TMPDIR=/private/tmp`; the failed gate was explicitly reconciled rather
  than retried silently, and its original receipt is retained.

### Update — September 15 06:00 UTC: three parallel workers; goal-mode operation

Travis placed the manager in goal mode (poll subagents on an interval, advance
all three workstreams, Slack only if human help is genuinely required). Until
now the manager only ran when prompted: workers are independent TMUX processes
and kept running, but the review→receive→dispatch loop stalled between prompts.
Owner-daemon increment C (below) is the structural fix.

- **Accounting** ([PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md)):
  WS sampling allocation frozen (`f07a6e7ef`), reviewed by Opus 5.0 High (correct,
  0.83; two P3s fixed in `5c80b88ce`) and **received at `73fc51b1a`**; sprint
  repointed at `556da8be7`. First implementation attempt `acct-ws-impl-01`
  **correctly STOPPED** before touching code: the frozen allocation requires a
  manager-assigned exclusive build-target lease and none existed. Its receipt-only
  commit `4364dd53e` (0 lines in all 17 allocated Rust files, no Rust tests) was
  received at `94ea8948e`. Lease `acct-ws-20260915` has since been granted after
  comparing current reservations and actual diffs — a dedicated `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`,
  exclusive while no other Rust build is active — and `acct-ws-impl-02` is running.
- **Security** ([PF-83-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-83-s01-permission-confirmation.md)):
  the last open Remaining item is the independent code-blind functional gate. Its
  allocation (`8f5ed4270`, 472 lines: cases G01–G19 each with a negative control,
  enforced executor boundary, tiered 64/96/128-call budgets) was reviewed correct;
  three P3s fixed in `3dc6e6c5b` — most importantly the expanded case IDs must be
  normalized into the design manifest before dispatch or
  `qa/code-blind-functional/check.py` hard-fails the handoff even on a clean run.
  Received at `47acb6458`; harness increment 1 is running.
- **Task Node** ([PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md)):
  all three coordination tasks are **Rewarded** — evidence submitted and the
  verification requests answered after Travis approved the records ("approve all",
  Slack `Ev0C1N8EPLQ3`, feed rev 40). Both transport P3s closed in `e3b3b2da9`
  (received `7e6728f1d`): `flush` now skips intent-bearing events, including the
  crash case, and a test pins the real `send`→`post` idempotency wiring. Owner
  daemon increment C ("adds effects": real ACK/START/RETURN lifecycle, verified
  START, lease-based liveness, per-operation error isolation) is running.
- **Dashboard access**: the read-only service rejected the tailnet hostname with
  403 — a hardcoded Host allowlist (DNS-rebinding protection). `serve` now takes
  a repeatable `--allow-host` accepting exact DNS names only (no wildcard, suffix
  match, port or address literal), driven from `control.json.web_allowed_hosts`
  so it survives republication (`efbbf1403`). Verified on the server: loopback 200,
  tailnet host 200, `evil.invalid` 403. Remaining and **not** ours to fix: Serve
  only answers on the tailnet IPv6 address because another service holds
  `0.0.0.0:443`, and the node shared with Travis was `postfiat1`, not
  `productionrpc`.
- **Suite repair**: the YuE2 facilities merge updated one facility-count assertion
  but missed the second, leaving the Python suite red on integration. Fixed in
  `f65639e89`.
- **Briefing ceiling**: manager cycles were failing `briefing_size_hold` every run.
  45 consumed allocation stubs were shrunk to the minimum the coordinator requires
  (frozen originals retained in the audit table), 21.8 KB → 15.2 KB.

### Update — September 14 13:15 UTC: overnight close-out

- **Root cause of the blockers**: the Mac's login keychain locked overnight
  (~12:00Z). Raw HTTPS egress is fine, but the Corbanu binary's auth/keyring path
  blocks on the unlock prompt, so *every* new model session stalls (three held
  Fable runs, a review probe, a Luna publisher) and `git push` prompts for
  credentials. Unlocking the Mac restores all of it; no config was changed.
- **PF-83 verification (clean env)**: app-server 1356/1374 (13 failed + 5 timed
  out, none in PF-83 areas; the 15 PF-83-area tests passed); TUI 3955/4098 (106
  failed + 37 timed out, mostly snapshot/provider/onboarding suites; 10 touch
  permission/settings rendering). **Attribution unknown** without a baseline run
  on `da456599d`; the merge stays unverified and unreverted; Slack question open.
  Test artifacts (`.snap.new`, tmux artifacts) retained privately, tree clean.
- **Not dispatched** (Fable decisions blocked): `owner-daemon-impl-02` and
  `slk-harness-impl-02` allocations are prepared; dispatch resumes after unlock.
- Local integration tip is ahead of origin by three commits; the dashboard still
  shows `build-lasnxjjf` (`d4f61a978`). First morning actions: unlock → push →
  republish → baseline run for PF-83 → answer/dispatch pending increments.

## STOP — user-requested management pause, September 13

All three workstreams have reached a checkpoint and stopped. The implementation
subagents are closed, security owner paused and both management monitors paused.
[Integrated checkpoints, evidence and remaining gates](../../../docs/plans/management-pause-2026-09-13.md).
This deliberate pause is not an unanswered question. No successor work or live
enablement; older progress notes below are historical and do not authorize work.

## Current handoff — September13 02:27 manager cycle

02:32 update supersedes the pending preflight below: PF13 source/evidence is
received throughc51d2d6aa, original30 exits/reviews inspected; exact combined
RTX/TMUX qualification dispatched to its sole owner. James formatting passed,
actual1370/614; no dependency build yet. Slack OFF launcher preflight passed,
no state/credential access; durable live/phone/ACK remains unqualified. Feed22
records zero open human decisions, with previous questions/resolutions preserved.

Parent serializes dependency/build lease. [Slack credential handoff resolved](slack-access-decision.md); durable alert/reply/phone/nativeACK and independent execution remain manager work, not an unanswered user question.

Combined session proof accepted; no native activation.
- [PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): 1970-line compact import returned with reported19+5/594/100 test passes. Manager review01 found a test that requires nondeterministic SQLite race diversity; Mendel is correcting it within the [same allocation](../../../docs/research/agent-cost-accounting/compact-late-import-allocation.md), retaining Mac target. No product approval or S03 activation.
- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): [bounded fixture-only ingress](../../../docs/research/tasknode-integration/owned-ingress-allocation-20260913.md) coding dispatched to James at verifiede2400ed95, ten crate-local paths. Parent supplies dependency/build lease after accounting correction; source authoring continues. [Private credential handoff](slack-access-decision.md) still needed only for live Slack; installation approvals remain resolved.

## Current handoff — September13 combined session accepted

Existing owner gets the exact combined receiving test next; no new human approval or native-service claim. Same-sprint successor is design-only pending combined proof and exact allocation.

## Current handoff — September13 combined proof accepted

- [PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): [combined100/575/Clippy/check all pass](combined-native-20260913.md). Mendel dispatched at clean37d6ffcc9 on the [complete eight-path compact-only import operation](../../../docs/research/agent-cost-accounting/compact-late-import-allocation.md), target2000/650 STOP2200/750, new accounting-late-import checkout and exclusive Mac target. S03 stays dependent and collection OFF.

Existing owner dispatched on [private root-session pump](../../security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/descriptor-root-session-allocation-20260912.md), seven paths700/800, reviews37/38. No new native/public bootstrap or protected activation.
- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): [private credential-path handoff already requested](slack-access-decision.md); installation/scopes stay complete. Pinned tiny_http cannot bound ingress/cleanup through its public APIs, so the old proxy proposal is not implemented. James prepares an exact opt-in same-binary owned-ingress scope using maintained existing parser/runtime machinery. Manager infrastructure, not another user decision or a qualified executor.

These are same-sprint continuations after accepted evidence, not new initiatives,
main/release or whole-sprint completion. Historical failures remain preserved.

## Current handoff — September13 00:14UTC

- [PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): reviewed933/279 candidate received2cb69e429, combined with security at eb5855959.

- [PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): reviewed740-line source and literal evidence received at eb5855959. Existing sole owner confirmed no pause and launched the same28-command RTX/TMUX proof against this combined source. No duplicate review or new native activation; successor stays a proposal until combined proof.
- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): [installation complete; private credential handoff already requested](slack-access-decision.md). Feed18 shows this distinct setup question, not another access approval. James inspects actual pinned proxy timeout/body/schema APIs before a minimal infrastructure allocation. Corrected646-line/12-test engineering is accepted, not full isolation or live Slack qualification.

No implementation source is being edited during combined verification. Current
assignments are manager Mac tests, sole security owner RTX tests and two bounded
preparation tasks. Main, release, sprint acceptance and protected activation are
unchanged. The previous installation publication is verified separately; this
new receiving observation awaits one Luna sync.

## Current handoff — Slack installation completed

- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): Travis approved access and separately approved the installation agreement. Reinstall is complete, the bot is in the private channel, and Socket Mode/private reply events are enabled. [Exact setup evidence and remaining credential handoff](slack-access-decision.md). Both required token environment inputs are absent in this runner; no token was extracted. Manager owns actual connection, bounded no-op alert/reply/native-ACK and independent qualification once privately provisioned. Alerts remain non-operational. The resolved access question must not reappear as a hold.
- [PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): corrected ten-file candidate933/279 has100 focused/575 shared tests, normal check, Clippy and clean material review.

Manager has read the evidence and source; scoped receiving and exact combined proof are next. No native activation or sprint-completion claim.

Isolated engineering646/650 passed12 actual RTX tests and correction review02;
accepted as engineering only, not a complete independent executor. Standing
manager instructions now require proactively initiating authorized blocking
tests or dispatching eligible execution; manager-owned must not mean unstarted.

## Current handoff — 23:16 UTC

- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): actual browser preflight found missing bot posting/private-history permissions and reply events, despite Socket Mode being ON. [Access question and context](slack-access-decision.md) was asked directly; live setup waits for Travis's confirmation, not a repeat of prior product approvals. Supervisor code remains integrated with261 passing tests. Five-file isolated engineering returned588 lines/11 actual RTX tests; first independent boundary review is running, not accepted execution. Manager owns remaining confined executor/transport qualification.

Original eight Core errors cleared;24 emitted errors at16 existing native-test sites remain. Manager inspected/allocated only those assertions and dispatched Mendel at524674860; same ten files/ceiling, runtime frozen. [Exact continuation](../../../docs/research/agent-cost-accounting/core-policy-repair-allocation.md). First material review follows correction; S03 stays dependent, collection OFF.
- [PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): sole owner confirmed same final-c7 RTX run completed23:03:38, all28 command exits+suite0. Sourcec7d48e482/Rustbd56b597, original source-guard failure preserved; no test ran on the mismatched source. Owner is preparing literal receipt and already-allocated reviews35/36; manager has not yet accepted that new increment. No duplicate test run, main or protected activation.

The only human hold is the already-asked Slack access expansion. Accounting
correction, PF13 review closeout and independent infrastructure review continue.
No sprint is complete. Last verified dashboard publication22:49:26/source527238dfd;
this updated observation awaits one Luna synchronization.

Actual RTX feasibility is complete; James is implementing [five-file isolation engineering](isolated-boundary-engineering-20260912.md), with effective seccomp/cgroup/cleanup and positive PTY controls. A confined fresh reasoning executor, independent functional execution, real Slack connection/phone/native ACK are still manager-owned prerequisites. Alerts are not operational.

Owner acknowledgment22:47: PF13 imported the allocation at clean00b07dad10b215e756696f8c5477055f1e1722d5, source unchanged from12e0bc2d8; owner checkers3/115/125 pass. Root-dispatch implementation begins; earlier acknowledgment-pending wording above is superseded.

No decision is awaiting Travis. Local receiving integration is not a main merge,
sprint completion, native qualification or release. One Luna publication verifies
this observation separately. Earlier observations are retained history.

main or release acceptance. Publication is verified separately by one Luna sync.
Earlier dated observations below are history, not competing current statuses.

## Current handoff — 21:03 UTC

- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): recovery review07 clean and locally integrated at a89a48548; all251 receiving tests pass144.128s. James dispatched to implement the real supervised listener in the fresh slack-supervisor-20260912 checkout, source-start179172541. [Exact assignment](../../../docs/research/tasknode-integration/slack-supervised-quiescence-allocation.md). Live Slack/phone/restart/CAS/native-ACK and isolated functional acceptance remain unproven; no user answer needed for this implementation.
- [PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): accepted native implementation passes71focused/840shared receiving tests and normal check. Mendel dispatched to repair concrete policy-lint failures in the fresh accounting-policy-repair-20260912 checkout, source-start179172541. [Exact seven-file assignment](../../../docs/research/agent-cost-accounting/policy-lint-repair-allocation.md). Historical full-Core failures are not waived; compact late import follows, S03 remains draft, collection OFF.
- [PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): combined Stage A proof accepted. Existing sole owner resumed Stage B from30923e30f; initial3 real connector/admission and2 normal tests passed. At measured791 lines the owner stopped appropriately; manager granted same-seven-path hard900 for remaining tests/runner only, runtime frozen. [Disposition and next proof](../../security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/descriptor-admission-allocation-20260912.md). Reviews30/31 remain required; no native activation or sprint completion claim.

All three lanes have implementation assignments. Halley separately owns a
read-only audit of existing isolated-execution runner sources, with a concrete
infrastructure handoff; no fourth product initiative or qualified sandbox claim.
Root policy1.7 is already on local main8cfcff990; product work is on the declared
receiving branch, not claimed merged to main or released. No new human decision.
Publication of this observation is pending the single Luna synchronization.

## Historical observations

Latest security follow-up: [combined receiving RTX proof](combined-native-20260912-1911.md)
passed all eight required scoped checks on unchangedc5e606fa2/Rust18cf961a.
The broader dependency-lint failure remains disclosed. Existing owner is
freezing the already-approved pair-stage allocation, then implementing within
hard800 lines; no user decision or whole-PF27 acceptance. Accounting receiving
verification and Slack recovery remain their separate ongoing assignments.

## Current observation — 19:18 UTC

- [PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): review03 clean; exact24-file accounting candidate locally integrated. Mendel dispatched on combined receiving verification, not another source correction. Prior full Core/shared failures remain visible; serial targeted passes do not erase them.
- [PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): reviewed adapter/single-child62956038e merged locally with accounting atc5e606fa2. Existing owner active on two-child proposal and then exact receiving RTX proof. Approval resolved; broader native/product gates remain.
- [PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): James dispatched on the five-file local fence-loss recovery in fresh worktree tasknode-slack-recovery-20260912 at cleanefb0f95f8. Gated predecessor is integrated; real supervisor/connection/phone/ACK still unqualified, live OFF.

[Combined integration evidence and exact limitations](combined-native-20260912-1911.md).
One source implementation worker, one receiving-verification worker and the
existing security owner task are assigned. No open human decisions. Mainf505bd211
is an older Facilities/service-control import, not the declared receiving source.
Last verified publication18:48:22/build-p4f8ktvl; new source awaits one Luna sync.

## Current observation — 18:39 UTC

18:47 final observation: [Slack integration evidence](slack-integration-20260912.md)
records clean review06,244 staging passes, receiving243pass/one enforced
source-drift guard, then exact1/1 rerun with stable source. No runtime repair or
waived error; gated code is locally integrated, not live. Accounting now has
24 disjoint source/test/receipt files and3900/1450 ceiling for the scoped
redirect-policy correction. Security confirmed active/no pause: source60068b967,
final RTX/TMUX proof complete, Astra25 running and Fable26 next. No user blocker.

18:41 update: combined Slack review06 is clean;244 staging tests passed133.965s,
Facilities/governance pass. Manager accepted staging3561ebcc2 for local receiving
integration and imported13 identical code/receipt/guidance files, preserving
newer plan/sprint records. Receiving full tests are running. This supersedes the
running review below, not the still-open missing-fence/live qualification gates.

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): recovered test profile now executes28 accounting and42 role tests, all pass. Full Core3405pass/133fail/19skip/2leaky is non-clean; all133 failure names also occur on the launch baseline. Review02 found redirects bypassing approved-endpoint accounting attribution. Mendel is dispatched to disable accounted redirects while preserving existing OFF/proxy/CA/guard behavior, with real two-endpoint zero-follow proof. Existing20-file scope; shared API changes require manager disposition, not a human blocker.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): worker237 tests pass; imported into manager staging with owner-lease-aware status and19 passing feed tests. One combined review06 and full combined suite are running on16paths3131total/1314non-test. James prepares a private minimal missing-fence recovery proposal only; no live credentials or code changes during review. Full Slack/phone/ACK gates remain.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): next single-child owner focused8/real3/service52 pass, four artifact skips explicit. Existing task was idle; manager requested already-allocated artifact/TMUX/parity/review closeout subject to any newer explicit user pause. Owner checkpoint78185b756 and adapterfb7523f4b are not yet native receiving integration. Isolated-adapter approval stays resolved.

No new decision is required. Accounting correction is dispatched, Slack source
is frozen for manager combined proof/review, and security closeout is requested
from its sole owner. Last verified publication18:15:20UTC/build-akhq3xe5 matches
971db3c8d and feed10 with zero open decisions. This semantic update awaits one
Luna sync; source collection and rendering are not implementation completion.

Facilities observation18:19:52UTC: six interface targets returned200; the
[Drone ACE-Step fallback](http://100.81.145.102:7866/) refused connection.
The primary RTX ACE-Step remains reachable. This is an interface availability
issue, not a dashboard server failure or a blocker on the three workstreams.
No service repair or restart is authorized by this observation.

## Current observation — 18:09 UTC: continuation, not human holds

18:14 follow-up: Slack review05 returned one confirmed initial-qualification
retry deadlock following auth failure. James is now dispatched on its narrow
recovery correction and regression tests; review06 follows the changed candidate.
The manager recorded exact scope/size and retained all234 tests/review history.
Thus the current work is one active security task, one accounting verification
worker and one Slack correction worker, not the running review05 described at
18:09 below. No user answer or new product contract is required; live stays OFF.

- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): adapter handoff fb7523f4b is qualified on the owner's branch; literal Astra23/Fable24 both findings[]. RTX focused3/OS7/service44 (one explicit exclusion)/profile2/TMUX7 pass. Alex's GNU2.39 host proves unsupported rejection only. Manager allocated the next private synthetic single-child asynchronous owner, bounded cancellation/cleanup/quarantine and real late-spawn proof. Sole existing security task is active; no duplicate worker or new user decision. Native source30b471a47 and evidence fb7523f4b remain pending receiving integration; approval allocation c5b05d9d8 is reconciled here.
- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): first role-override correction returned3436total/983non-test. API208 and state287 pass,3leaky; Core tests stopped before execution with59 compiler diagnostics following shared-target baseline reuse. Manager authorized exactly32 enumerated recoverable fingerprint moves and locked/offline rebuild; Mendel is dispatched on verification, not a new product contract. All132 original candidate failures also occurred on the matched baseline; zero candidate-only failures in that original comparison does not prove the corrected candidate. Review/integration follow actual tests. Collection OFF.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): lifetime-lock/session-lease correction returned234 passing tests,2558total/990non-test across seven files. Independent Astra High review05 is running on the frozen source; implementation worker returned. Manager owns importing the exact frozen helper into shared status-registration staging, combined tests/review and the separate missing-fence recovery requirement before live connection. Live Slack/posting OFF.

Zero open manager decisions. One security task is active, one accounting
verification worker dispatched, and one Slack independent review is running.
No sprint is complete or human-test-ready from these internal results. Last
verified publication17:26:18UTC, source ef4b8e531/build-d1po25v1; this semantic
refresh awaits the current heartbeat's single Luna publication. Earlier
observations below are historical and do not override resolved decisions.

## Current observation — 17:24 UTC: isolated adapter approved

- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): Travis explicitly approved the [isolated adapter](pf27-launch-adapter-decision.md). Feed revision9 records resolution against question revision1 at17:23:24UTC. The existing owner was instructed to record/check its allocation and resume adapter implementation, independent review and non-root tests across available configured Linux hosts. Owner acknowledgment is pending; no invented running-worker, privileged-installation or live-credential claim.
- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): first review's dropped role retry/timeout settings P2 is accepted; its bounded correction is queued after the active matched baseline diagnostic. No new human decision, collection OFF.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): manager narrowed the recovery proposal and dispatched the lifetime-lock/session-lease correction to James at17:22. Broader recovery-send/quarantine/migration is excluded; missing-fence recovery remains a pre-live manager requirement. Shared18-test status-registration staging is unaccepted; live Slack/posting OFF.

There are no open decisions in the current manager feed. Engineering, review and
acceptance gates remain; this does not mark any sprint complete. The prior
17:15:52 publication succeeded; this user-answer update is not yet published.
Older stopped-worker counts and approval holds below are dated history.

## Current observation — 17:12 UTC

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): native caller returned frozen at87a9a81ad,3017total/904non-test. Focused native tests pass, API208 and state287 pass; full Core3401passed/132failed/19skipped/1leaky is not clean. First independent review is running. Mendel is assigned a matched clean-launch baseline diagnostic to distinguish regressions from existing failures, without editing the candidate. No new human answer required; OFF, not S02/S03 acceptance.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): third Slack correction passed225 tests,2116total/840non-test. Review04 found a real lost-outage issue after abrupt listener termination. Source edits pause for a concrete session/fence recovery contract, including the already-known missing-fence recovery route; James prepares the bounded proposal and manager owns its decision. Shared CLI/cache/per-question status code is underway in separate staging, with a passing actual local-ingress/two-question revision test. Live Slack and posting remain OFF.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): owner021f82e6 remains clean; [isolated-adapter question](pf27-launch-adapter-decision.md) is still the last-known open decision. Main406aa3c5 remains reconciled. No inferred approval or duplicate security worker.

Both source candidates have returned: zero source-implementation workers at this
observation, one baseline-diagnostic worker, one recovery-design worker and one
independent review. These are manager-owned next steps, not new human blockers.
Last verified publication16:17:16UTC,4b9904d30/build-52koqg3r; user-turn private
index/Facilities HTTP checks also passed16:55. This update awaits this heartbeat's
one Luna sync. Earlier observations below remain historical.

## Current observation — 16:13 UTC

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): Mendel is dispatched on actual native Anthropic sampling from87a9a81ad: per-send durable admission, retry identity, raw usage presence, trusted original prices and native recovery tests.20 disjoint source/test/receipt files, default OFF. Manager completed the existing SQLx test dependency under the security owner's narrow lease and released it. This is implementation, not a finished sprint or live collector.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): first Slack correction passed208 tests. Independent review found three more real integration defects; James is assigned their second coherent correction. Manager owns shared registration and actual private Slack/phone/ACK proof. No new user decision required; live OFF.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): owner021f82e6 freshly checked clean; the [existing isolated-adapter approval](pf27-launch-adapter-decision.md) remains open. Dependency-file coordination did not grant that approval or resume security implementation.

Last verified publication15:49:41UTC fromc8358dd9b/build-qxq_400c, both private
endpoints and seven Facilities links passed. Current semantic update awaits
this cycle's one Luna sync; historical observations follow.

## Current observation — 15:45 UTC

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): normal-library store reviewed clean and integrated at9518184ac;367 combined state/TaskNode tests pass, one leaky. Mendel prepares the exact actual provider/runtime caller assignment. Collection remains OFF; S02 is not complete and S03 remains dependent. No new human blocker.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): first real-SDK candidate passed198 Python tests, but independent review found four ingress/recovery bugs. James is assigned their coherent correction plus the agreed narrow scopes and ongoing listener behavior. Manager owns shared registration, actual Slack/phone/agent-ACK qualification; live Slack is not operational.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): the [isolated-adapter question](pf27-launch-adapter-decision.md) remains the existing user decision, not dashboard publication approval. No approval is inferred from “press on.”

Last verified publication15:23:11UTC, generationbuild-mla2tqxg, source21c8da489;
remote and local private index/Facilities returned200. This update is queued for
the normal Luna sync; no user click is needed. The dated observations below are history.

## Current observation — 15:19 UTC

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): two earlier issues corrected with286 passing state tests; the next review found a production deletion-time race under concurrent accounting updates. Mendel is correcting it, with a specifically approved proof-size allowance. No new human answer required; collection OFF.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): James implements real Slack transport/bridge. An independent20-case human-style test design is frozen, not executed. Manager freshly verified the approved private Slack channel and Travis membership; its Agents & apps tab has no bot row, so the historical webhook installation is not a working two-way connection. Registration, bot/setup, private phone access and real reply/ACK proof remain manager-owned.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): [existing isolated-adapter question](pf27-launch-adapter-decision.md) remains open; owner021f82e6 unchanged. Other implementation continues independently.

Last verified publication14:59:46UTC frome0ba52947, generationbuild-vbt9k49f;
index and Facilities succeeded through remote and local private endpoints.
Main406aa3c5 is still reconciled. This later semantic update awaits the current
heartbeat's one Luna sync, not another publication click.

## Current observation — 14:55 UTC

Two source workers are running; dashboard publication needs no user click.

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): normal-library store candidate returned with284 tests. Independent review found two real issues: concurrent deletion on default profiles and an aggregate-overflow write that could block later reads/deletion. Mendel corrects both in the existing17-file scope. This is active engineering, not waiting on Travis; collection stays OFF.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): offline Slack recovery is reviewed/integrated at9877c058d;169 receiving Python tests and Facilities pass. James now implements [real Slack SDK transport and native-agent reply bridge](../../../docs/research/tasknode-integration/slack-live-allocation.md) from cleanba3a2457c. Manager owns shared registration and actual connection/phone qualification. Slack is not yet operational.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): [isolated adapter approval](pf27-launch-adapter-decision.md) remains unanswered; owner021f82e6 is unchanged. This existing human hold does not stop the other two initiatives.

[Receiving/review evidence](integration-20260912-1356.md) preserves corrected
failures and exact acceptance limits. Last verified publication14:22:46UTC from
b26d1b935; this later observation awaits this heartbeat's one native Luna sync.

## Current observation — 14:18 UTC

Two source implementation workers are running. [Review/integration ledger](integration-20260912-1356.md)
retains earlier results and the current bounded correction disposition.

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): Mendel now implements the [normal-library opt-in store](../../../docs/research/agent-cost-accounting/production-store-allocation.md), clean launchef13b347c. Allocation reviewed clean and integrated;17 files, default no-install/collection OFF. Native354-test acceptance remains valid; full S02/S03 is not complete.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): James corrects a concurrent decision-revision race at final handoff.167 Python tests passed on the prior candidate; review03 identified this remaining issue. Manager performed scope/convergence review and authorized one narrow same-owner correction plus review, not another contract or user blocker. Real Slack remains unconnected.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): the [isolated adapter question](pf27-launch-adapter-decision.md) remains open at owner021f82e6; no new answer or repeated alert. Independent work continues.

Last verified publication:14:01:06UTC from8aeebf72d. These later observations await
this heartbeat's one native Luna Extra High sync; no publication approval is pending.

## Current observation — 13:56 UTC

Publication is healthy; no click is required. [Receiving evidence](integration-20260912-1356.md)
supersedes older implementation/review observations below.

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): native ownership/deletion bridge is independently reviewed and integrated at8725e1ff7;354 combined native tests pass. Mendel prepares the exact normal-build opt-in store allocation; production source dispatch follows manager acceptance, not another human approval. S03 remains dependent.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): James corrects the second-review edited-reply recovery finding after161 Python tests. Earlier two duplicate-delivery findings were corrected; this candidate has not passed final review or integration. Real Slack transport/registration follows, with live delivery OFF.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): [isolated Linux adapter approval](pf27-launch-adapter-decision.md) remains open at unchanged owner021f82e6. Accounting and Slack continue independently; no repeated question or inferred approval.

One source implementation worker runs (Slack correction), one allocation worker
runs (accounting), and the manager owns integration. This source awaits this
heartbeat's one verified publication; no live result is inferred.

## New decision — 13:14 UTC

[PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md)
now has an [explicit approval question](pf27-launch-adapter-decision.md), ID
`pf27-linux-launch-adapter`: authorize a narrow separately audited unsafe/FFI
adapter while retaining the main broker's unsafe-code prohibition and all live
authority gates. A concrete libc backend was located; this new trust-boundary
decision supersedes the earlier manager-only capability search. Recommendation:
approve bounded implementation and non-root tests, not installation or live use.
Two independent implementation workers continue: accounting and Slack recovery.
The decision is recorded for dashboard projection and asked in the manager task;
Slack is not connected, so no Slack alert is claimed.

## Current observation — 13:05 UTC, September 12

Two implementation workers are dispatched, not merely a running dashboard timer.
No new answer is required from Travis for these assignments.

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): Mendel implements the [native ownership/deletion bridge](../../../docs/research/agent-cost-accounting/native-ownership-allocation.md), clean launch165da0ef3. Three allocation documents reviewed clean and integrated; exact six-path scope, real native/thread/accounting transaction proof, production OFF. Full S02 and S03 readiness are not claimed.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): James implements [offline Slack sender/reply recovery](../../../docs/research/tasknode-integration/slack-recovery-allocation.md), clean launch8dd9274b4. Allocation reviewed clean; five new files, durable attempts/uncertainty, revision-bound resolution and restart-safe handoff. Actual Slack transport, scopes/credentials and first real delivery remain next, not connected yet.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): launch implementation remains held at owner1b4ac697 for a real safe process backend. Manager now asks the sole owner to qualify one concrete GNU pidfd_spawn lead, not repeat broad dependency searches. No build/invocation/main window or new user question.

F01 age and legal-ID history closure are independently supported by actual browser
evidence. [Evidence disposition](age-evidence-20260912.md) retains DEC021's
mixed-feed useful-content failure and baseline-provenance limit; this does not
block the independent offline Slack assignment or create unqualified human readiness.
Last verified publication: d19e34b16 at12:37:35Z. This source awaits this run's
normal native Luna sync; earlier observations below remain historical.

## PF-27-S04 follow-up — 12:42 UTC

[Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md)
has a concrete technical hold on its next launch implementation. The manager
read owner checkpoint1b4ac697: inspected safe APIs either replace the caller or
return a PID without the proposed stable process-ownership guarantee. No real
supported backend yet meets the complete selected contract. The manager owns
backend qualification and assessment of which API constraints are actually
required; no safety guarantee is waived, no mock-only implementation is accepted,
and no new question is waiting on Travis. Accounting allocation and dashboard
browser verification continue independently. This is not a failure of the
already-landed parser. Dashboard publication fromd19e34b16 succeeded12:37:35Z;
this later observation awaits the next scheduled sync.

## Current observation — 12:32 UTC, September 12

Publication approval remains resolved; no user click or new answer is needed.
Last verified publication was12:04:01Z from3ba7b121. The following newer receiving
results await this heartbeat's single native Luna sync; no live result inferred.

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): complete C2 atomic retention/deletion passed independent review and was integrated atd5608c58d;346 combined state/TaskNode tests passed. Mendel now prepares the exact native ownership/deletion bridge allocation, not another retention prerequisite. No implementation of that successor is claimed yet; S03 still depends on full S02.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): F01 age fix1a6d9c8df is reviewed/integrated,122Python tests and Facilities Node regression pass. Review caught a legal decision-ID collision; corrected before integration and rerun clean. Laplace executes actual desktop/phone/history/redaction proof now. Slack sender/reply proposal is prepared; manager allocation and live configuration still pending, not user approval.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): parser406aa3c5 is reconciled. Sole owner returned concrete read-only descriptor preflight atb496da56 after the empty task readbacks. Report identifies process-launch fallback/cleanup ownership choices for manager disposition; no code/build/invocation or new execution authorization is inferred. Manager reviews the proposal next, not waiting on your answer.

[Review and receiving evidence](integration-20260912-1232.md) distinguishes these
accepted increments from full sprint, live integration or human-test readiness.
The following older observations are retained history, not current assignments.

## Current observation — 11:56 UTC heartbeat, September 12

Native Luna publication succeeded at11:40:05Z fromafe535c06, including Music
Studio and all six existing interfaces. Duplicate desktop publisher archived;
saved native-worker instructions now prohibit redelegation. No user click needed.
This newer source awaits the next normal verified sync; no publication inferred.

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): Mendel returned without edits because C1's interim deletion-rejection assertion contradicted C2. Manager inspected and authorized only that sixth-path test adaptation, preserving full replacement success/rollback proof. Clean launchadb36c528; same native Astra High worker resumed. No user decision or review pass spent on that correction.
- [TaskNode PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): [F01 age correction and Slack successor preparation](../../../docs/research/tasknode-integration/decision-age-followup.md) allocated. Original browser evidence independently checked; DEC021partial and DEC025advisory retained. Exact worker dispatch is reported separately; no live Slack/posting claim.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): reviewed parser406aa3c5 landed on main and reconciled into receiving43e1e7864. Fable22P3 test gap corrected with actual rerun, not relabeled clean. Main window released. Descriptor-launch proposal is manager review/preflight only; no artifact invocation approved.

No newly required human answer. These observations supersede earlier assignments.

## Current observation — Music Studio link integration, September 12

The publication approval issue is resolved: nothing to click. Previous native
Luna publication succeeded at10:40:01Z; this new source awaits its own verified
publication. [Facilities link evidence](music-studio-link.md) records the
seven-entry update, unchanged six service controls and limited keyboard proof.

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): C1 reviewed clean and integrated; combined native tests335passed,2leaky,0skipped. C2 allocation/dispatch is manager work still pending, not a running agent or user blocker. S03 remains dependent.
- [TaskNode PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): independent browser evidence check returned; relative-age defect and partial redaction/advisory evidence gaps need targeted follow-up. Slack sender/replies and live mapping remain unqualified; posting OFF. No repeat authority question.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): static feasibility checkpoint97d4cb6e landed and is reconciled. Existing owner is authorized for bounded sealed-byte ELF inspection after recording exact allocation; no protected execution or installation claim.

These observations supersede older worker assignments below. No new human decision.

## Current observation — 10:37 UTC, September12

Publication approval is resolved; there is nothing to click. A separate source
pointer drift was reconciled while preserving Facilities. Final correction review
is clean;118 Python tests and the Node UI regression pass. Native Luna publication
postflight is next, not yet claimed. See [reconciliation details](facilities-reconciliation.md).

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): C1 returned255passing state tests. Manager explicitly authorized review of1121total/396non-test lines to preserve its detailed proof; Aristotle is reviewing. C2 remains next after acceptance, S03 dependent. No user size decision.
- [TaskNode PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): all26 original browser cases executed at72854ec77. Helmholtz independently checks evidence; an additional static relative-age display defect is retained. Slack sender/replies and live mapping qualification remain pending; posting OFF.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): reviewed sealed-image checkpoint140e094ad landed on main and is reconciled; main window released. Sole owner is authorized for build-only static-probe feasibility under the accepted next proposal. No artifact invocation, protected execution, loader trust or installation claim.

These observations supersede earlier assignments below. No new user question.

## Publication recovery — 10:19 UTC, September12

The obsolete publication task was archived through Codex's supported task tool.
Codex now confirms its pending run is interrupted and the task is not loaded;
the cancellation message confirms no further publication action. History is
retained. There is no outstanding approval for Travis to find or click.
The stale-task overlap hold is cleared. One fresh native Luna Extra High sync
will publish the declared receiving source; success must be verified separately.
Earlier approval-waiting observations below are history, not current blockers.

## Current observation — 10:10 UTC, September12

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): Boole is implementing C1 fixture activation/admission/retained reads at clean launch4642785db. Explicit setup state preserves all A/B assertions; C2 atomic cleanup/deletion is the fixed next increment, S03 still dependent.
- [TaskNode PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): corrected immutable feed72854ec77 is reviewed clean and integrated at9a31f3aac;111combinedPython tests pass25.362s. McClintock is executing actual desktop/phone/keyboard cases on synthetic local pages. Independent evidence and Slack sender/reply implementation remain pending, not live.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): manifest2c7c4e6c0 landed and is reconciled. Sole owner has accepted sealed-image preparation next, with two new scoped reviews. No protected exec, loader-trust or installation claim.

No new product question. Routine mapped TaskNode progress is authorized after
technical qualification, still OFF. The old declined publisher is unchanged
at app approval-waiting as of this observation; no overlapping sync or live claim.
Earlier observations below are retained history.

## Current observation — 10:02 UTC, September12

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): reduction B is independently reviewed and integrated at7514be8ec. All330 combined state/TaskNode tests pass. Manager prepares the coupled retention/read/delete/admission allocation, resolving fixture setup explicitly; no new user decision or S03 activation.
- [TaskNode PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): feed wiring returned553changed lines with109 passing tests; scoped code review is running. One real-server regression and desktop/phone/keyboard plus independent evidence remain outstanding. Slack is not connected; live progress remains OFF pending qualification.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): manifest checkpoint2c7c4e6c0 passed Astra16/Fable17 and RTX3/35/356 tests (two existing affected-suite skips). Fresh exact-checkpoint owner main window granted; actual landing/release confirmation pending. Inspection only, not protected execution or installation.

The declined publisher still lacks confirmed app termination; no duplicate
publisher or live-dashboard freshness claim. Local integration continues.
Earlier observations below are history, not current agent assignments.

## Current observation — 09:46 UTC, September12

Canonical source a0e2c3270 includes accepted launcher, retention-input A and
corrected offline decisions. Two native implementation workers are now assigned:

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): Rawls implements pure retention reduction B after A passed review and325combined state/TaskNode tests. Runtime/read/delete/admission and S03 remain later.
- [TaskNode PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): Anscombe implements feed export/activation/render/health wiring in fixtures after corrected offline records passed review and100combinedPython tests. Slack delivery/reply routing follows; not connected yet.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): launcher cc931adf6 landed on main and reconciled locally. Sole owner has an accepted next manifest-inspection allocation and two new scoped reviews; no privileged installation/execution.

No new user decision. Integrator recorded extra review allowances without
resetting history. Earlier decision-record defects were reproduced and corrected
before integration: stale answers could resolve changed context; canonical
encoding could exceed storage limits. All original functional cases retained.
Human browser/keyboard/phone evidence and live delivery remain unqualified.
Routine mapped TaskNode progress is authorized once qualified, still OFF.
Old publisher remains app approval-waiting despite decline; no overlapping sync
or claim these new source records are live. Prior observations below are history.

## Current observation — 08:48 UTC, September 12

This supersedes historical candidate notes below. Canonical receiving is
reconciled at b8da69d744aa65ea68e5b71c199d401922f84602. Two implementation workers
were dispatched, not merely an active scheduler:

- [Accounting PF-60-S02](../../../docs/sprints/current/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02-idempotent-usage-persistence-and-replay.md): Ohm is implementing read-only retention planning. Latest quote is reviewed/integrated; S03 awaits full S02 qualification.
- [Task Node PF-80-S01](../../../docs/sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md): Curie is implementing offline decision records and contextual notices. Native validity is reviewed/integrated. Slack sender/replies remain unconnected.
- [Security PF-27-S04](../../../docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md): sole owner completed Astra12/Fable13 under an integrator extension. P3 fixture portability is a follow-up, not a runtime defect; RTX qualification and owner-controlled main landing remain distinct.

Travis delegated additional review authorization to the integrator. No new
review-spend question is needed; substantive functional/security/human/dependency
gates remain. Routine redacted progress to existing mapped Task Node targets is
authorized once delivery is qualified; posting remains OFF until then. Slack
completion is prioritized within the active sprint. No task acceptance, rewards,
financial action, public beta posting or new recipient is authorized.

The old publisher was declined; app termination is being verified before fresh
native Luna sync. This local record does not prove the new source is live.
No repeat product approval or wallet seed is requested.

These are manager observations, not automatic acceptance. Supersedes the
September 11 recovery-source cards. Canonical sprints remain authoritative.

## Workstream 1 — PF13 / security

PF13 owner reports Travis completed the human test and authorized integration.
Owner verified main d870c92dab2bf3fbb602dc3b8447fe9f3534aecb after RTX531 selected
Rust passes, package28/gate11, build/package/wallet startup and actual-key provider,
tool/trusted-app journeys. Manager receiving source reconciles this accepted main
without discarding newer accounting/TaskNode work. PF35 external classifier
qualification is separate and not proven by PF13 human acceptance. Manager must
retain the owner's new PF27S04 allocation as a separate continuation; do not
silently mark the whole security program complete. PF35's engineering reservation
is draft/external in accepted main; no detector qualification claim.
Human next action: none requested by this dashboard repair.

## Workstream 2 — Accounting

Defaults and conservative UTC-day aggregate expiry approved; PF60S01 archived,
PF60S02 in progress. Latest-quote increment returned for independent manager
review and combined-tree validation. Worker reports 242 full-crate tests passed;
this is not yet an integrated candidate or human-test readiness.
Next manager action: review the returned increment, integrate and allocate atomic
retention/read/delete/admission. Custom ranges/intervals remain in dependent S03.
Human next action: no repeat policy approval. Test runtime views only after a
candidate-bound guide is supplied; no live billing or collection enabled.

## Workstream 3 — Task Node

Existing Mac publisher and native server-backed nullable-expiry validity direction
approved. PF80S01 in progress; native-validity increment returned for independent
manager review and combined-tree validation. Worker reports 80 full-crate tests
passed; no public caller or live validity qualification claimed.
Next manager action: review/integrate, then scoped dashboard decision/Slack alert
wiring and recovery work. The private Slack channel/app exist, but automatic
alerts are not yet operational. Live posting stays OFF independently of code
progress. No new wallet secret needed for this implementation assignment.
First live event still requires exact scoped authority, supported task lifecycle,
current validity/enrollment and reviewed payload. Historical PF76 events stay
held; no silent mapping to PF80, replay, task acceptance or public beta launch.

## Dashboard checks for a human

Open workstreams; click blocked labels to read the named sprint's reasons.
Hover/focus an in-progress label, then click/tap to read its full latest note.
Confirm the source banner names the manager receiving checkout, not recovery.
Answering a question does not complete a sprint; disabled posting does not mean
implementation is waiting on that answered question. A stale/failure banner
means last-known information, even when the page itself is reachable.
