# Milestone "Aggressive ships": second targeted re-run (2026-10-14/15)

Second targeted code-blind functional re-run of the P1 security milestone, after the first targeted run
([../aggressive-20261014-targeted](../aggressive-20261014-targeted), #788: 53 passed, 3 failed, 8 blocked of 64). Owner
decision of 2026-10-14T22:58:14Z on #447. **Not passed: the milestone needs Travis's named sign-off.**

## Result

Re-run on this candidate: 4 cases, **2 passed, 2 blocked** ([dispositions.md](dispositions.md), [results.json](results.json)).
Accepted by the owner without execution: 4 cases.

Combined status of all 64 cases (this run where re-run or accepted, the first targeted run's record otherwise):
**55 passed, 2 failed, 3 blocked, 4 accepted by the owner**.

- Now passing, after failing or being blocked in the first targeted run:
  - AGG-04: before the restart, the vault command and the Corbanu-home read are refused with the Aggressive wording
    and no Grant once; the inspector's Vault row now says the store and sign-in file are unreadable (#792, fixed in
    #799); an ordinary write asks first and Esc leaves it unrun.
  - AGG-37: screen 07 splits what applies now from what starts at the restart; no Restarting banner stays after r;
    the refusals after the restart are readable; the active level is easy to find.
- Accepted by the owner, not passed (#447): AGG-18, AGG-R07, AGG-R10 and AGG-20 are covered by the product refusals
  shown elsewhere. AGG-20 is also a named limit: refusing a full-access role at child start needs a person to start
  the child with that role through `/spawn`.
- Blocked:
  - AGG-R03 (keystroke driver): pane A was left for pane B before its prompt appeared, but within the 15 s wait pane A's
    approval prompt took over pane B's view. It offers only Enter, Esc and "o to open thread", so `/security` could not
    be reached without answering the prompt. The driver stopped there, as designed. Same block as in every earlier
    run. #818 asks the owner how this case should be reachable.
  - AGG-R14 (keystroke driver): the child's command prompt appeared after the parent's question was answered. An Enter
    on its highlighted "Yes, proceed" 11 s later was refused, and only then did the prompt add "This is a new request.
    Choose an option with ↑/↓, then enter". The command never ran and the kill switch was never turned on (#817). The
    executor reported the Enter as the approval time; the integrator corrects that.
  - AGG-R06: no Claude Code in the guest (a named limit, unchanged).
- Failed, unchanged: AGG-T01 and AGG-T02 (#739). The owner chose option B on 2026-10-14T22:58:13Z, but its fix had not
  merged when the design was frozen ([design/issue-739-at-freeze.txt](design/issue-739-at-freeze.txt)).
- Issues filed (advisory):
  - #816: before the restart, screen 07, the review and the picker say the Aggressive sandbox for approved commands and
    network-off start at the restart. The inspector says they apply already, and a host check agrees (see AGG-04 below).
    The product protects more than screen 07 says.
  - #817: the AGG-R14 Enter refusal above.
  - #818: the AGG-R03 question above.
- `qa/code-blind-functional/check.py` stops at AGG-01 ([checker-output.txt](checker-output.txt)), the first case
  carried over from an earlier candidate. That is expected for a targeted run. A clean checker pass needs every case
  passed on one candidate.

## Owner decisions applied (#447, 2026-10-14T22:58:14Z; #739, 2026-10-14T22:58:13Z)

- **Amendment 5** ([design/amendments5-final.md](design/amendments5-final.md)):
  - AGG-37: S1 is reached in the run. After the restart it adds AGG-04's two requests, so that there are denial
    messages to review. Expected results are unchanged; result 3 is judged on those refusals.
  - AGG-R03 and AGG-R14: the starting conditions and product actions are played by frozen keystroke drivers
    ([executor-packet/v6/drivers/](executor-packet/v6/drivers/)) with `agms-drive`
    ([harness/agms-drive](harness/agms-drive)). The executor starts the driver, presses no keys in the product, does the
    case's own-shell steps afterwards and judges every result code-blind. If the driver stops early, the executor does
    not continue by hand.
  - Dispositions without execution: AGG-18, AGG-R07, AGG-R10 and AGG-20 are accepted (AGG-20 also a named limit).
    AGG-T01/T02 are unchanged (#739 not merged). AGG-R06 is unchanged.
- **Drivers:** written by a fresh read-only designer (`corbanu exec`, Opus 5.5 High) from the case text, the testers'
  tools and this candidate's screens only ([design/designer-packet/](design/designer-packet/),
  [design/designer-output.md](design/designer-output.md)). The integrator's mechanical regex-vs-screen list was given
  to the reviewer as data ([design/review-packet/drivers/regex-lint.txt](design/review-packet/drivers/regex-lint.txt)).
- **Review and freeze:**
  - One fresh read-only reviewer checked the draft table and both drivers against the decision comments, the case text
    and the screens ([design/amendment-review-output.md](design/amendment-review-output.md)). Its verdict was CHANGES,
    with a final table and a final AGG-R03 driver (shorter sleeps around leaving pane A; two guarded Down presses).
    Both were applied verbatim; AGG-R14's driver is the designer's.
  - The reviewer's freeze precondition was checked on the host before the freeze: a stop inside an `if` branch ends
    the whole driver ([design/driver-halt-check.txt](design/driver-halt-check.txt)).
  - Frozen with SHA-256 at `aaf2f999f7` (committed 2026-10-14T23:56:22Z, pushed 23:56:25Z), before the VM was started at
    23:56:35Z ([design/FROZEN.sha256](design/FROZEN.sha256)).
- **Design screens** of this candidate ([executor-packet/v6/new-screens-5/](executor-packet/v6/new-screens-5/)) were
  captured on the host Mac in a disposable profile before the driver design. They include a child-agent request in
  which the child's model did not run the command (V31-V34); that was a design-time capture, not a test result.

## Scope

- Executed: AGG-04 (V01), AGG-37 (V02), AGG-R03 (V03, driver), AGG-R14 (V04, driver). Each group had a fresh executor
  and a fresh product profile.
- Not re-run: the other 60 cases keep the first targeted run's record (44 of them from the third run). Of these, the
  4 owner-accepted cases are recorded as accepted rather than blocked.

## Candidate

`origin/main` `df3d8c5d1c521228a8dbb1035831af572afe1284` (includes #797, #798, #799, #801), packaged macOS arm64 0.1.48,
`bin/corbanu` SHA-256 `0deeb58c…e1049b3` ([candidate/candidate-manifest.md](candidate/candidate-manifest.md)).

## Execution

- **Where:** UTM guest "macOS 3" only, per `qa/code-blind-functional/isolated-execution.md`, with the first targeted
  run's harness ([harness/](harness/), paths adapted, plus `agms-drive` and `guest-shutdown-clean.sh`).
- **VM start:** "macOS 3" was started with `utmctl` at 23:56:35Z, after the freeze. "macOS 2" stayed stopped, and no VM
  was created or deleted. As in the first targeted run, the guest didn't answer on the network and ignored a shutdown
  request, so it was power-cycled with `utmctl` at 00:06:52Z ([common/vm-start.txt](common/vm-start.txt)).
- **Guest state:** found at baseline ([common/guest-state-start.txt](common/guest-state-start.txt)). It was then
  provisioned fresh ([common/effective-policy.txt](common/effective-policy.txt)).
- **Isolation gate:** re-measured before any executor ([common/gate/](common/gate/)). 85 probes ok; GitHub and
  example.com were unresolvable; inference was reachable; the smoke turn returned `AGMS-SMOKE-OK`. Every group re-ran the
  probes, and every executor ran them itself; all isolation receipts are true.
- **Native-prompt guard:** stayed clear, with 0 `SECURITYAGENT-SEEN` in 2,787 checks
  ([common/guard-final.txt](common/guard-final.txt)).
- **Groups:** V01-V04, 00:11Z to 00:51Z, one at a time on rotating lanes wiped before and after. The executor and the
  product under test were the candidate on GLM 5.3 Flash (`zai`). No replays.
- **Shutdown:**
  - Guest data was erased (`restore.sh`, `kill-lane-procs.sh`, `restore-fix.sh`), and the guest was shut down cleanly
    from inside.
  - It was booted once more to check that the erase had persisted: no campaign accounts, `/opt/agms`, `~/agms`,
    canaries, sudoers file or pf rules, and `/etc/codex` restored.
  - This run's admin helper scripts were then removed. A shutdown request was ignored, so the final clean shutdown ran
    `guest-shutdown-clean.sh`. That script deletes the helper folder it runs from; this last deletion was not checked by
    another boot. Both VMs are stopped ([common/vm-state-end.txt](common/vm-state-end.txt)).

## Integrator host checks (not code-blind)

After the run, to explain AGG-04 and #816: before the restart, with Aggressive confirmed, an approved `curl` to
example.com could not resolve the host, which the host itself reaches. An approved write outside the folder was refused
([host-checks/](host-checks/)). Both used the candidate package (via `cap/product.sh`) on the host, with a disposable HOME
and CORBANU_HOME, no native keyring, and GLM 5.3 Flash on zai.

## Evidence check

See [review-ledger.md](review-ledger.md) and [review/](review/). The budget is 5, counted from 0 for this record; the
driver design and the amendment review used 2 of them.

## Known limits

- macOS only. There is no code-blind milestone execution for Windows or Linux; that is a limit, not a pass.
- This is a targeted run: 60 cases rest on earlier candidates (`4440d2d4ce`, and `4b6dd55c85` for those carried from the
  third run).
- AGG-R06 (kill switch interrupting a Claude pane): there is no Claude Code in the guest. AGG-20 is a named limit (above).
- The drivers can only press keys and branch on visible text. A product behaviour that needs a different key than the
  screen states (#817) or a view that a prompt takes over (#818) stops them; they were not changed after the freeze.
- Isolation of the designer, reviewer and checker is instruction-only (read-only sandbox, no OS read restriction).
- Executors run the candidate's `corbanu exec` with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. They are confined by
  the OS account, per-uid pf and file modes, verified by the probes.
- The synthetic `.env` token appears in the harness's fixture records (`fixture*.json(l)`, driver logs), never on the
  product's screen.
- Lane processes: 12 or 13 processes owned by the lane account were still running after each wipe
  (`runs/*/wipe-after.txt`, a count only); lane agmx1 was reused for V04.
- Relay windows: each run's `mediator-window.jsonl` starts 2 minutes before its executor and may hold the end of the
  previous run's requests. No disposition rests on relay traffic.
- Product logs (`*.log` under `product-logs/`) and product homes are kept out of the record. Each run's test project is
  under `runs/<label>/collected/fixture/`, with its git directory renamed `dot-git/`. PTY logs are gzipped. The driver
  logs (`driver-*.log`) are in the record.
- The design screens and the host checks used the host Mac with a disposable profile and the real Z.AI key
  (integrator-only captures, never a test case). The designer and the reviewer ran the installed `~/.local/bin/corbanu`
  (read-only sandbox, Opus 5.5 High; [design/designer-session.txt](design/designer-session.txt),
  [design/amendment-review-session.txt](design/amendment-review-session.txt)).
