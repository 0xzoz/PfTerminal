# Milestone "Aggressive ships": third targeted re-run (2026-10-15)

Third targeted code-blind functional re-run of the P1 security milestone, after the second targeted run
([../aggressive-20261014-targeted2](../aggressive-20261014-targeted2), #819: 54 passed, 2 failed, 4 blocked, 4 accepted
of 64). Owner decisions of 2026-10-15 on #447, #816, #817 and #818 ([design/decisions/](design/decisions/)).
**Not passed: the milestone needs Travis's named sign-off.**

## Result

Re-run on this candidate: 4 cases, **3 passed, 1 blocked** (AGG-T01 with its #626 step as part B, AGG-T02, AGG-R03,
AGG-R14). Judged again on the second targeted run's recorded screens, without re-running (owner decision): AGG-04 and
AGG-37, **both passed** ([dispositions.md](dispositions.md), [results.json](results.json)).

Combined status of all 64 cases (this run where re-run or re-judged, the second targeted run's record otherwise):
**58 passed, 0 failed, 2 blocked, 4 accepted by the owner**.

- Now passing:
  - AGG-T01 (was failed, #739): part A, at Permissive with protected launch on, no prompt offered to run the write
    outside the sandbox; both requests ended in a sandbox denial ("Operation not permitted"), and the file kept its N
    lines. Under Aggressive, before and after the relaunch, the prompt appeared and Esc left the command unrun. Part B
    (the #626 step, a rule saved with protected launch off): the rule ran the write twice; with protected launch on it
    skipped the prompt but showed the note that it now runs inside the sandbox, and the write was denied; under
    Aggressive, before and after a relaunch, the prompt said the remembered approval "was not applied because security
    level Aggressive is on". The file ended at N+2. The executor marked part A failed on the old advisory result, which
    amendment 6 moved to part B (see AGG-T01 in [dispositions.md](dispositions.md)).
  - AGG-T02 (was failed, #739): back at Permissive (quit and relaunch, as the screen offered), the request ran without a
    prompt and was denied by the sandbox; the file kept N lines.
  - AGG-R03 (was blocked in every run, #818): from a second Corbanu Terminal on the same home, the kill switch went on
    while terminal A's approval prompt was pending. Within a second A said the switch was turned on in another Corbanu
    Terminal and the turn was stopped; the prompt was gone, the typed y showed "Not sent" with the kill-switch message,
    and ks-pending.txt was never created.
  - AGG-04 (was blocked pending #816): judged against amendment 6 on the second targeted run's run V01. The inspector's
    rows before the restart show only what holds from confirmation, and screen 07 separates now from restart; it
    understates (lists the sandbox and network-off under the restart), which amendment 6 allows for screens before #834.
  - AGG-37: its pass stands under amended result 1.
- Blocked:
  - AGG-R14 (advisory): the first attempt was blocked early: the parent's model asked to run its own polling command
    before the child's prompt appeared, and the frozen driver answered nothing, as written. The integrator then ran one fresh
    replay with the same driver; that was the integrator's own decision, not one a frozen rule or the owner provides for. Both attempts are
    recorded and result 1 rests on the second alone. In it, the driver's Enter on the child's prompt drew no refusal and
    no "new request" notice (#817). The screen shows no approved line; the product's log has the approval, the
    child's exec_command tool call returning about 12 s before the kill switch, and the kill switch interrupting the
    child's turn ([runs/W04-a2/product-log-excerpt.txt](runs/W04-a2/product-log-excerpt.txt)). The record does not show
    whether the command was still running when the switch went on. ks-child.txt was absent 90 s after the kill switch,
    well after a running sleep 60 would have written it (result 1 passed). Result 2, "the child shows it was stopped", is blocked: only the parent's turn
    notice is shown, and `/panes` lists no child, because the model spawned it rather than `/spawn` (#867).
  - AGG-R06: no Claude Code in the guest (a named limit, unchanged).
- Accepted by the owner, not passed (#447, unchanged): AGG-18, AGG-R07, AGG-R10, AGG-20 (AGG-20 also a named limit).
- Issue filed (advisory): #867, the AGG-R14 result 2 question above.
- `qa/code-blind-functional/check.py` stops at AGG-01 ([checker-output.txt](checker-output.txt)), the first case carried
  over from an earlier candidate. That is expected for a targeted run; a clean checker pass needs every case on one
  candidate.

## Owner decisions applied (2026-10-15)

- **Amendment 6** ([design/amendments6-final.md](design/amendments6-final.md); part 7 of
  [executor-packet/v7/amendments-and-new-cases.md](executor-packet/v7/amendments-and-new-cases.md)):
  - AGG-04 result 3 and the screen 07 split in AGG-04 and AGG-37 follow today's behaviour (#816, fixed in #834): what
    holds from confirmation may show as in force; what holds only after the restart may not; screen 07 must still name
    the restart-only protections; a pre-#834 screen that lists already-held protections under the restart understates
    and does not fail. Both cases rest on the second targeted run's recorded screens.
  - AGG-T01/T02 follow #739 option B (no offer, a plain refusal or sandbox denial, the file unchanged, the note for a
    remembered rule). The #626 step is AGG-T01 part B, its own group: a rule saved with protected launch off
    (`-c features.secretless_agent_launch=false -c allow_login_shell=false` on the first launch only; the second flag
    makes the saved rule match the command later launches send, see
    [executor-packet/v7/new-screens-6/README.txt](executor-packet/v7/new-screens-6/README.txt), Y vs Z), then
    Permissive with protected launch on, then Aggressive before and after a relaunch.
  - AGG-R03 runs from a second Corbanu Terminal on the same home, played by a new frozen driver
    ([executor-packet/v7/drivers/AGG-R03.json](executor-packet/v7/drivers/AGG-R03.json)). The harness gained
    second-terminal steps (`agms-tui --term 2`, [harness/agms-tui](harness/agms-tui),
    [harness/agms-drive](harness/agms-drive)); a host smoke of those steps with a fake product is in
    [design/harness-smoke.txt](design/harness-smoke.txt).
  - AGG-R14 replays the second targeted run's frozen driver byte-for-byte (SHA-256 `0310f8cb…89701`).
- **Driver design and review:** a fresh read-only designer wrote the AGG-R03 driver from the case text, the draft table,
  the tools and this candidate's screens ([design/designer-output.md](design/designer-output.md)); its first attempt
  died with no reply when macOS blocked the Corbanu home and was retried once. A fresh read-only reviewer checked the
  table and both drivers against the decisions, the case text and the screens
  ([design/review-output.md](design/review-output.md)): verdict CHANGES, with a final table and a final AGG-R03 driver,
  applied verbatim (the table rows were checked identical by script).
- **Freeze:** SHA-256 in [design/FROZEN.sha256](design/FROZEN.sha256), committed and pushed at `9daaaf93b8`
  (2026-10-15T21:32:55Z/21:32:58Z), before the first VM start attempt (21:33:10Z). The executors checked the packet,
  driver and candidate digests themselves.

## Candidate and execution

- Candidate: origin/main `4c9b0a0cf0` (contains #813, #834, #835), Corbanu Terminal 0.1.48, `bin/corbanu` SHA-256
  `d8fc9509…1fdf4` ([candidate/candidate-manifest.md](candidate/candidate-manifest.md)). origin/main moved to
  `7666bdf3d4` before the freeze with CI files only.
- VM "macOS 3" only; "macOS 2" stayed stopped; no VM created or deleted. The first start was refused by UTM because the
  VM's shared folder (/Volumes/FASTDRIVE2/z23) was missing: the host drive had been unmounted at 21:25:42Z, outside this
  run. The lock was released and the coordinator told through a request file outside the repository
  ([common/vm-start.txt](common/vm-start.txt)); this run changed neither the drive nor the VM settings. When the drive
  was back the run continued (22:49Z).
- Isolation gate: the first probe failed one positive check because the harness still expected the previous
  candidate's digest; after correcting `expected.json` it passed 85 of 85, with a smoke turn on GLM 5.3 Flash
  ([common/gate/](common/gate/), [common/effective-policy.txt](common/effective-policy.txt)). No system password or
  Keychain prompt: 0 extra SecurityAgent processes in 3,160 checks.
- Executors: fresh `corbanu exec` sessions of the candidate on GLM 5.3 Flash (zai), one group at a time on lanes
  agmx1-3: W01 (AGG-T01 part A, AGG-T02), W02 (AGG-T01 part B), W03 (AGG-R03), W04 and W04-a2 (AGG-R14), 22:55Z to
  23:43Z ([runs/](runs/)).
- Closing: guest data erased and checked by two verification boots (no ~/agms, /opt/agms, agmx accounts, AGMS pf
  lines or admin helper folder; /etc/codex, `set skip on lo0` and the share restored). A shutdown request was not
  answered, so the already-verified guest was powered off with `utmctl stop` (23:49:42Z); the lock was deleted at
  23:49:43Z.

## Known limits

- AGG-T02's "Permissive active" rests on "Saved: Permissive", the relaunch, the request running without the prompt
  Aggressive shows for every command, and the saved level files; the executor took no `/security` screen after the
  relaunch.
- AGG-04 and AGG-37 were not re-run: they are judged on the second targeted run's screens (candidate `df3d8c5d1c`,
  before #834's wording), as the owner decided. This run's screens of the current candidate show #834's wording
  (for example W01's saved screen, "Also in force now in this session: …").
- AGG-04's inspector also shows "Nested agents: refuse (default) … refused while Aggressive is enforced
  [configured: /security]"; amendment 6 does not list the nested-agent refusal among the restart-only items.
- The packet says a part 7 amendment governs and that what it "does not mention stays as before"; W01's executor read
  that as keeping part A's old advisory result. The amended table replaces part A's expected results as a whole.
- macOS only; this is a targeted run, so 58 cases rest on earlier candidates. Entries carried in `results.json`
  (`carried_from`) keep the earlier records' paths, which resolve against those records (for example AGG-18's
  `design/decisions/issue-447.json` is the second targeted run's snapshot, not this record's newer one).
- Isolation of the designer, reviewer and checkers is instruction-only (read-only sandbox, no OS read restriction).
  Executors run the candidate's `corbanu exec` with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, confined by the OS
  account, per-uid pf and file modes, verified by the probes.
- The guard only monitors for a system prompt; it cannot prevent one.
- The synthetic `.env` token appears in the harness's fixture records (`fixture.jsonl`, driver logs), never on the
  product's screen.
- Lane processes (counts only; they may include the shell that took them; not identified): 6 processes owned by the
  lane account at the start of W01, W02 and W03 (`runs/*/wipe-before.txt`), 12 to 14 after each run
  (`wipe-after.txt`), and 13 at the start of W04 and W04-a2, which reused lanes agmx1 (from W01) and agmx2 (from W02):
  processes from an earlier run on the same lane were still running when the next executor started. At the end the
  processes found for the removed accounts were `/usr/sbin/distnoted` (`common/kill-lane-procs-end.out`).
- Relay windows: each run's `mediator-window.jsonl` starts 2 minutes before its executor and may hold the end of the
  previous run's requests. No disposition rests on relay traffic.
- The AGG-R14 driver leaves the product running when it ends; W04-a2's executor did not stop it, and the run's cleanup
  ended it.
- Product logs and product homes are kept out of the record, except the W04-a2 excerpt above. Each run's test project
  is under `runs/<label>/collected/fixture/`, with its git directory renamed `dot-git/`. PTY logs are gzipped. Driver
  logs and the host's run log (`runs/seq.log`) are in the record. As in earlier records, `harness/` leaves out the
  synthetic mediation CA certificate, the fixture archive and the capture lane's settings file.

## Review budget

[review-ledger.md](review-ledger.md): 5 of 5 used, no extension requested: the driver design, the amendment review and
three independent evidence checks. r1 and r2 failed on points that were corrected and confirmed by the next check; r3,
the last within budget, confirmed every disposition and asked for one mechanical fix (the record's copy of
`harness/expected.json` was the pre-correction file), which was made but not independently re-checked.
