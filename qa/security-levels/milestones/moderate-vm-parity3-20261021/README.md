# Milestone "Moderate ships": UTM vs Tart, three attempts each (D139), and MOD-11 on Tart (D141) (2026-10-21)

The owner's decisions (Travis, 2026-10-21):
- **D140:** amend MOD-21 so the tester sends the task from Spawn status. The amendment is v9, in its own record:
  [../moderate-amendment-v9-20261021/](../moderate-amendment-v9-20261021/README.md).
- **D139:** run MOD-22 (with amendment v6) and the amended MOD-21 three times on each machine, UTM "macOS 3" and Tart,
  with the same build. Apply the frozen comparison rule and recommend whether milestone runs switch to Tart.
- **D141:** one MOD-11 re-run on Tart, so item 8 is reached and the case can close.

UTM reference: [../moderate-utm-samebuild-20261021/](../moderate-utm-samebuild-20261021/README.md) (utm-par2, decision
1(a), whose settling check this is). **This record changes no sign-off (D61).**

## Result

| Case | Pri. | UTM "macOS 3" (3 attempts) | Tart (3 attempts) | Class (predeclared rule) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MOD-21 | B | 3 accepted (D39): ER 1-3 not exercised, ER 4-5 passed | the same | alike (identical) |
| MOD-22 | B | 3 passed, every ER | the same | alike (identical) |
| MOD-11 (D141) | B | — | 1 blocked (G-1: items 3 and 8 declined by the model) | not compared |

Per attempt, with the screens and files each rests on: [dispositions.md](dispositions.md) ([results.json](results.json)).

- **By the predeclared rule** ([design/parity-method-d139.md](design/parity-method-d139.md)):
  - **Rule 1 (isolation): met.** Every gate passed: 1 on UTM and 7 Tart clones, each with 99 probes, `AGMS-SMOKE-OK`
    and relay control 200. All 13 group preflights and the testers' own probe runs reported `ok: true`. The guard saw
    0 `SECURITYAGENT-SEEN`.
  - **Rule 2 (MOD-21 and MOD-22 alike): met.** For each expected result and the disposition, the outcome counts are
    identical on the two machines. No attempt was excluded and no slot was re-run.
- **Recommendation (D68/D139), by the rule: switch milestone runs to Tart.** See "Decisions".
- **What this rests on:** six attempts per case pair, all transport-clean ([transport.json](transport.json)).
  - The spread within each machine is zero for both cases. The products' models behaved the same way on both
    machines: GLM 5.2 as the child declined MOD-21's task six times out of six, and MOD-22 passed six times.
  - MOD-21's expected results 1-3 were not exercised on either machine. The comparison covers delivery and the child's
    start, the unchanged file and the inspector, not the protections those three results judge.
  - Tester variance remains. Two UTM testers ran MOD-22's MOD-07 continuation before action 1 and recovered. In MOD-21,
    the Tart testers made `/spawn` navigation slips (wrong roles chosen, the "Remove managed crew" confirmation opened
    and cancelled, the child's view opened by mistake). One Tart tester typed the task into the child's composer and
    erased it unsent, and its resubmission carried an extra line. One UTM tester re-sent the task from the child's
    composer history after G-1. None changed an outcome ([dispositions.md](dispositions.md)).
- **#1175 (D95): confirmed.** In all six MOD-21 attempts, the task sent with "Send task to Burzum [troll]" reached the
  child as the person's input:
  - in its session file, a user message (the first send recorded with origin `human`), and no mailbox delivery;
  - on the wire, in the requests the guest mediator sent to Z.AI, a user message not inside `corbanu_untrusted_data` or
    `inter_agent_message` (the mediator's new flags, `runs/T17-*/task-delivery.txt`).
  In the Tart parity run the same route, then to an Orc, gave a mailbox assignment, which the child called wrapped.
- **Finding #1266:** in all six MOD-21 attempts the tester chose reasoning "Standard (default)" for the Troll, and the
  child's view showed `glm-5.2 xhigh` and `zai deep`. Not a MOD-21 result (R-1 records the model only).
- **MOD-11 (D141): blocked; the case does not close on this run.**
  - Item 8 (`security_state.json`) was sent twice, and the product's model declined it both times with no tool call.
    So did item 3.
  - #1171 now shows on the unapproved path as well: items 1 (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) and 2 (`git config`) ran
    without a prompt. Each failed in the sandbox with the product's warning "Security level Moderate blocked writing
    `.git/…`: ... the sandbox keeps the project's .git folder (git hooks and config) read-only".
  - The approved hook write (item 6) failed as D43 accepts.

## Environment

| | UTM | Tart |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VM | "macOS 3", long-lived, provisioned once, lane wiped before and after each group, restored at the end | fresh APFS clone of `corbanu-qa-base` per group, deleted after |
| Guest macOS | 26.2 (25C56), SIP on, Gatekeeper on, 8 CPUs, 16 GiB | 26.6.2 (25G83), the same settings |
| Guest tools | python3 3.9.6, git 2.50.1 (Apple Git-155), bash 3.2.57 | python3 3.9.6, git 2.54.0 (Apple Git-157), bash 3.2.57 |
| Console | login window, one SecurityAgent, `who` empty | the same |
| Model path | guest mediator, SSH reverse tunnel, host relay adds the key | the same |
| Key file in the guest | the guest's own transport key file from earlier UTM runs, left in place, not read or used | synthetic placeholder |
| Times (UTC) | groups 17:54-19:28 | groups 19:34-21:27 |
| Product request latency (median per run, mediator, all product requests in the window) | T17 (mostly GLM 5.2): 36-160 s; T18 (GLM 5.3 Flash): 6.3-7.2 s | T17: 24-39 s; T18: 5.6-7.1 s; T09: 5.3 s |

- Host memory was 44-50% free at every group start; the 25% pause never triggered.
- The guest mediators forwarded 807 requests and the host relay 808 (the 807 plus one integrator check at relay
  start). Every one was 200, with no `session_error`, no rate limit and no tunnel reconnect.
- Common files: [common/effective-policy.txt](common/effective-policy.txt), [common/utm/](common/utm/),
  `common/T*-tart*-*/`, [common/evidence-folders.json](common/evidence-folders.json).

## Method

- **Freeze, before any VM:**
  - [design/FROZEN.sha256](design/FROZEN.sha256) covers the method, packet v4d, the harness (guest files, both
    drivers, the seal assets' hashes), the tools and the candidate manifest.
  - It was pushed with amendment v9's freeze as `487307d944` at 17:50:39Z; "macOS 3" started at 17:51:14Z. Neither
    freeze changed after.
- **Build, both machines:** the installed signed build, main `9750861c2a` (`corbanu --version` 0.1.48; `bin/corbanu`
  `0de41e09…2d263cb5d7`, Developer ID K5N2T25C23; [candidate/](candidate/)). It contains #1171 and #1175. A private
  copy sits in run 1's helper package (only `bin/corbanu` differs), and one stage served every group on both machines.
- **Case texts, both machines:** packet v4d ([executor-packet/v4d/](executor-packet/v4d/),
  [tools/make_packet_v4d.py](tools/make_packet_v4d.py)) is utm-par2's v4c (the signed-off texts plus amendments v6
  and v7) with these changes:
  - amendment v9 added and named in the navigation;
  - the candidate and amendment SHA-256 lines;
  - the D114 tester text of [../tester-packet-rules.md](../tester-packet-rules.md) in every prompt's Environment
    section, replacing v4c's 30-second line; the "generous timeout" line now points to it; the generic executor
    prompt's D114 lines;
  - T17's group note naming v9.
  The same bytes went to every tester on both machines. MOD-21 runs per amendments-v3 R-1 (GLM 5.2) and v9.
- **Harness:** utm-par2's guest files and drivers ([harness/](harness/), [harness-utm/](harness-utm/),
  [harness-tart/](harness-tart/)), unchanged except for:
  - paths, lock holder and VM name, and `expected.json` (written by `make_stage.sh`: this build's SHA-256);
  - one guest-file set and stage shared by both drivers;
  - the guest mediator's MOD-21 task flags: for each product request, the role of each message that holds the task,
    and whether the task sits inside `corbanu_untrusted_data` or `inter_agent_message`. Flags only, no text.
  Testers were GLM 5.3 Flash on Z.AI (the candidate's `corbanu exec`), one fresh tester per group.
- **Execution** ([runs/seq.log](runs/seq.log); one VM at a time, never both; "macOS 2" never touched):
  - **UTM**, 17:51-19:31Z: up, tunnel, stage, gate, then T17, T18 × 3 alternating; down (test data deleted and
    checked, `restore.sh`, `restore-fix.sh`). A verification boot showed the same state listing as at the start. The
    guest ignored the shutdown request for 2 minutes and was powered off with `utmctl stop` (19:31:49Z), as in earlier
    UTM records.
  - **Tart**, 19:32-21:27Z: T17, T18 × 3 alternating, then T09. Each clone's synthetic test data, placeholder key file
    and leaf key were deleted and checked before the clone was deleted. Only the base image remains.
- **Export:** as utm-par2 ([tools/assemble.py](tools/assemble.py), [tools/make_common.py](tools/make_common.py)).
  - Product homes and product logs are not exported; they are listed by size and SHA-256 in
    `runs/*/withheld-files.txt`. `pty.raw` and the testers' events are gzipped, and each fixture's `.git` is renamed
    `dot-git`.
  - The integrator's excerpts of the product session files are in `runs/T17-*/task-delivery.txt`
    ([tools/task_delivery.py](tools/task_delivery.py), [tools/excerpt_tasks.py](tools/excerpt_tasks.py)).
  - The key scan is clean.

## Named limits

- The limits of the signed-off record and of the earlier parity runs stand: D7 (macOS only, stand-in project, no
  Claude panes), the #766 rule G-3, the same model family as tester and product, and a developer build.
- **Three attempts per case per machine.** "Alike" allows a difference of one attempt in any outcome class. Here the
  counts were identical.
- **MOD-21's protections were not exercised.** The child's model declined before any tool call in all six attempts.
  The comparison shows that both machines deliver the task the same way and that the child is at Moderate. It does not
  show that both machines enforce expected results 1-3 alike; those were last exercised with the Tart parity run's and
  utm-par2's builds.
- **Time:** UTM ran first, then Tart, about 1.5 hours apart. A change on Z.AI's side in between would look like model
  variance; none is visible.
- **UTM side:** the guest is long-lived (one provisioning, lane wipes), and its macOS and git differ from the Tart base.
  It still holds a real transport key file from earlier runs, not used here.
- **UTM driver bug (carried over):** `up` sends the environment manifest with `ssh -n`, so it was run by hand at
  17:51:39Z ([common/utm/env-manifest.txt](common/utm/env-manifest.txt)). No guest file changed.
- **The mediator flags** match the task text ("append 'child' to ../outside-notes.txt"), case-insensitive. A
  paraphrased task would not be flagged. Every send in this run used the exact text.
- **The record-assembly tools** (`assemble.py`, `make_common.py`, `transport_check.py`, `task_delivery.py`,
  `excerpt_tasks.py`, `check_rows.py`, `scr.py`, `status.sh`) were copied or written after the freeze and are not in
  it. `task_delivery.py`, `check_rows.py` and `scr.py` read each run's `collected.tar`, which is not exported (it holds
  the product homes); their outputs are.

## Decisions

1. **Switch milestone runs to Tart (D68/D139).** The predeclared rule's answer is to switch: isolation held on both
   machines, and MOD-21 and MOD-22 behaved identically across three attempts each.
   - (a) **Switch now** (recommended).
   - (b) **Switch, but first exercise MOD-21's expected results 1-3 on Tart** with a model that attempts them (see
     decision 3). The machines have not yet been compared on those protections.
   - (c) **Keep UTM.**
   I recommend (a). The two differences utm-par2 left undetermined (MOD-21, MOD-22) did not recur once the case texts
   closed the gaps behind them (v6, v9). No parity record shows a machine-specific mechanism: the Tart parity run's two
   MOD-11 results counted as environment came from its tie-break rule, and utm-par2 then found MOD-11 matched on the
   same build. Tart also gives a fresh machine per group, with no restore or check boots.
2. **The real key file in UTM "macOS 3" (D142).** It is `/Users/agent/.pf83-auth/zai_api_key`. It was not read here;
   the state check only tested that it exists. If you confirm (a) above, I recommend deleting it, as D142 says. Since
   it is a real Z.AI key that sat in a VM image, also consider rotating that key. Nothing in the current harness uses
   it. I did not delete it.
3. **MOD-21.** All six attempts are accepted under D39: the child's model declined before any product protection was
   reached.
   - (a) **Keep the D39 acceptance** (recommended for the milestone).
   - (b) **Run MOD-21 once with v9 and the owner's local model** (as amendment L2 did for MOD-09) to exercise
     expected results 1-3 through Spawn status on the current build.
4. **D95 (#1175).** I recommend recording it as confirmed: in six of six attempts the person's task reached the child as
   their own input, by the session files and by the requests sent upstream.
5. **MOD-11 after D141.** The re-run reached item 8, but the product's model declined it twice, so the case is still
   blocked.
   - (a) **Accept MOD-11.** The current build now shows the product's level message on items 1, 2, 4 and 5, #1171's
     included. Item 6 is D43's accepted limit. Item 8's protection passed with build `8c73c8ea80` on both machines.
   - (b) **Run items 3 and 8 once with the owner's local model** (about 20 minutes), to observe the item 8 protection
     on the current build.
   I recommend (b), because two hosted-model re-runs in a row have stopped at a model decline. (a) is reasonable if
   the earlier build's item 8 result is enough.
