# PF27 Stage B allocation: bounded private socket admission

## Review30 manager disposition — buffered peer shutdown

Manager read literal Astra30 JSON/exit1 and actual tick, connection helper and
connector. Accept its P2: MSG_PEEK returns an unread role/data byte even after
remote SHUT_WR, hiding EOF until drain/deadline and leaving the other reader
blocked. Existing helper read_exact drains that marker before admission. This
is an in-scope failure of the already-required pair-wide shutdown contract.

Authorize a narrow exception to the runtime254 freeze: change only the existing
socket shutdown check in pair_admission.rs, with corresponding same-file-scope
tests. Nonblocking poll for POLLRDHUP/POLLHUP/POLLERR (including invalid-descriptor
failure) must detect shutdown independently of buffered data; retain the
nonconsuming peek semantics. Readability alone is not a shutdown: healthy
buffered peers must stay live and application bytes remain intact. Poll failure
must fail closed, never establish peer liveness. No new API, dependencies,
fixture/runtime ownership or paths. Same seven paths and hard900 from6d770938c;
candidate863 plus estimated15–25 is not permission to exceed900.

Fable31 is already running on frozen93bbe3b18: let that actual operation finish,
preserve its input, and classify BOTH results before changing the candidate.
Do not duplicate it. First record an actual failing RTX regression against the
unchanged runtime. Peek the fixture role marker rather than draining it, retain
the original empty-EOF scenarios, add buffered-victim EOF for both roles, and
drain only the other role before testing that its reader blocks then wakes.
Preserve healthy buffered data, pair reaping/capacity and original failure logs.
Then repair, format and repeat final exact-source required proof.

Authorize exactly one additional scoped Fable5.1 High review32 via the existing
Corbanu/TMUX helper after both30/31 are classified and repaired proof passes.
Retain all reviews1–31; no budget reset, blanket follow-up pass or second opinion
on unchanged clean code. Any different contract/scope finding returns to manager.
Owner records this amendment and governance before edits; no human decision,
source push, native activation, whole-sprint or independent-functional acceptance.

## 21:02 UTC manager size disposition

Owner stopped before original800 ceiling and reported measured791: pair38,
pair_tests23, spawn3, admission254, admission_tests422, connector51. Manager
verified tracked diff counts and actual untracked line counts. Authorize same
seven paths with revised hard900 changed code/test/fixture lines, against the
same6d770938c baseline. Additional109 maximum is TEST/runner-only: committed
hash/profile runner35–45 and actual-pair pending-ticket/deadline cleanup25–40.
Runtime admission254 and existing wiring are frozen unless a concrete defect
requires separate manager disposition. Do not spend room on a larger API.

This explicit narrow above800 exception keeps one inseparable real admission,
cleanup and hash-bound runner proof; splitting the owner module now would add
two files and another acceptance boundary without reducing risk. Preserve every
required failure/race test, reviews30/31 and all historical attempts. Original
800/760 estimates below remain history, superseded only by this amendment.
No new review opinion, human question, product authority or independent-test
waiver. Record owner-side plan/sprint and pass governance, then continue.

Manager-authorized September 12 after literal combined Stage A proof acceptance.
Same sole owner /root, PF-27-S04 in progress, security-broker-resume-20260911
worktree and feat/security-broker-resume-20260911 branch. Original plan/worktree
base d870c92dab2bf3fbb602dc3b8447fe9f3534aecb remains unchanged; incremental B
size/review baseline is clean qualified owner6d770938c21f002dc572b084a1b428ad4a4379b0.
No rebase is required: the combined receipt verifies these exact A crate bytes.
Owner must record this allocation in its plan/sprint and pass both governance
checks before source edits. No GitHub push, native install or activation.

Manager read the full private proposal and verified combined receiving63cbce998:
all15 actual exit files zero, source/Rust identity, ten test summaries, positive
TMUX completion and unchanged lock hashes. Strict scoped lint and Bazel parity
pass; original setup failure and Bazel warnings remain. No additional A review.

Authorize exactly two new-source reviews30 Astra High and31 Fable5.1 High via
Corbanu/private TMUX, after final B proof. Record as explicit extension preserving
reviews1–29, not reset. Hard800 changed code/test/fixture lines; estimate760,
not measured. Scope breaks return to manager before additional edits; do not
remove proof to fit. Only this internal synthetic increment receives reasoned
functional N/A; later protected-user/PF26 gates retain policy1.7 isolation.

Manager receiving owner serializes combined integration and dependency edges.
No new writer to shared registrations/locks or fourth initiative is allocated.

## Baseline and preserved work

Owner qualified A:6d770938c21f002dc572b084a1b428ad4a4379b0;
sourcee0eb9eac4/Rustf64820d0. Receiving63cbce998c036aec65bd3bed82b2ba429ac47b51,
Rust205e89cd6a2c4739f76950da15367f30e636d26d, now passes combined proof
in pf27-stage-a-receiving-63cbce998.md. Count proposed B additions AND deletions
against the actual accepted A baseline, not an intermediate implementation.
If manager requires rebase to receiving first, preserve its accounting locks
and freeze the resulting exact baseline before writing code.

Read old db971e9b8 pair.rs/pair_tests.rs and current A pair/spawn/identity seams.
The archived combined WIP supplies an unqualified starting idea, not accepted
code/tests. It had no working connector and wrongly treated invalid expected-UID
construction as a substitute for real kernel-peer UID mismatch. Its tests omit
queue-full, lost deliveries, late cancellation and blocked-read wakeup. Preserve
that history; do not import it wholesale or count old unexecuted tests as proof.

## Proposed private surface

Keep A's `Reservation::launch_pair(images, deadline) -> Result<LaunchHandle,
(io::Error, PairImages)>` and all A tests intact. Add an admitting variant using
the same reservation, worker, child owners and pair cleanup, not a second owner:

`Reservation::launch_admitting_pair(images: PairImages, spec: AdmissionSpec,
deadline: Instant) -> Result<PairHandle, (io::Error, PairImages)>`.

`AdmissionSpec { generation: NonZeroU64, expected_uid: u32 }` is trusted private
input for fixed non-root synthetic probes. `PairHandle` delegates status/cancel
to its existing LaunchHandle and offers
`admit(UnixStream) -> Result<AdmissionTicket, (io::Error, UnixStream)>`.
Requests use bounded sync_channel(2) and try_send: full/disconnected returns
the caller's stream, never waits or creates an unbounded task. AdmissionTicket
has nonblocking `take_result`; dropping a still-pending ticket cancels the pair.
No generic stream getter on the process owner, no exported pidfd/numeric PID.

Successful `AdmittedPeer` contains private role, generation, stream and shared
cancellation. It is only a synthetic admission receipt, not PF20 authorization.
Before delivering a queued success, check sticky cancellation; a lost receiver
or dropped accepted receipt fences the pair. A subsequent cancellation shuts
down held stream clones, including receipts already delivered. No claim that
identity or a once-returned receipt proves perpetual liveness or tool authority.

## Admission and teardown

The same supervisor polls at most two queued requests per iteration so producers
cannot starve cleanup. Read real SO_PEERCRED UID and SO_PEERPIDFD; fail on missing
kernel support, wrong UID, dead pidfd, no unique match, duplicate role or stale
pair. Compare retained pidfd identities through accepted OwnedChild predicate;
derive role from which owned child matched, never connection order/peer bytes.
Check child state and cancellation before and after socket/identity work.

Retain at most one shutdown clone per admitted role. Pair death, cancellation,
deadline, caller/ticket/result loss, peer EOF or socket errors shut down both
accepted sockets and fence further admissions, while both child owners remain
held until reaped. Probe socket EOF using nonblocking MSG_PEEK without consuming
application bytes. All A signal/wait retry and panic-quarantine invariants remain.
No detached request worker, new permit, new unbounded queue or blocking handshake.

## Proposed exact paths and size envelope

All Rust paths under codex-rs/secret-broker-service/src/launch/manifest/:

1. pair.rs: integrate optional admission processing with existing lifecycle;
   private construction bridge/re-exports only, no duplicate cleanup algorithm.
2. pair_tests.rs: minimal test-seam conformance and A regression retention.
3. pair_admission.rs (new): pair-nested private module, queue/ticket/receipt,
   socket admission and teardown; can access pair-private state without widening
   crate API. Private identity seam implemented only by OwnedChild/test doubles.
4. pair_admission_tests.rs (new): deterministic failure/race plus real socket tests.
5. spawn.rs: narrow private cancellation-handle access for the admitting handle;
   no change to supervisor/permit/lifecycle contracts.
6. qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/descriptor-admission-20260912/connector.c:
   new synthetic static connector fixture, no embedded secret or external endpoint.
7. qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/descriptor-admission-20260912/qualify-rtx.sh:
   hash-bound fixture build/profile check and final real-key qualification runner.

Requested hard800 incremental changed lines. Planning envelope: runtime/wiring
250, tests350, connector110, runner50 =760,40 contingency. This is an estimate,
not a measured diff. Stop and return concrete split options before exceeding800
or deleting tests to fit. QA/plan/sprint evidence writes stay in existing reserved
owner boundaries. No Cargo/Bazel dependencies, manifests/locks, adapter unsafe/
FFI changes, children.rs/root.rs/PF20/Core/Vault/HTTP-client/installer edits.

## Real connector and proof cases

Use a separately compiled, static, profile-accepted synthetic x86_64 Linux
fixture with fixed recipe argv. A parent-owned abstract Unix endpoint can be
derived from parent PID for rendezvous only; naming is not authentication and
guessing it cannot pass descriptor admission. Fixture emits two independent
connections per actual owned child to test duplicate roles, then waits for
bounded synthetic control/closure. Role marker is observation only. Build and
record compiler invocation, source/artifact digests and accepted ELF profile
before executing through existing sealed-image and pidfd-owned launch path.
No root/setuid or production listener. Fixture build/profile failure blocks B
real qualification instead of falling back to a dynamic/unowned subprocess.

Required distinct cases, mapped to final logs with original failures preserved:

- Both actual owned roles admitted once; reverse arrival has same role mapping.
- Duplicate connection from a real owned child rejected; same-UID parent and
  unrelated real process rejected; retained old-generation connection rejected
  after cleanup/replacement; actual dead peer pidfd rejected.
- Real SO_PEERCRED UID mismatch is exercised by the private verifier with an
  intentionally different expected UID and an actual kernel-produced socket
  credential; constructor invalid-input alone does not satisfy this case.
- Queue exactly full returns the third stream; worker held behind a deterministic
  barrier proves bounded enqueue and cleanup after release.
- Ticket dropped pending, receiver lost after result formation, accepted receipt
  dropped, caller dropped: sticky cancellation, no stale success claim, both
  children reaped, capacity not reused early.
- Cancel/deadline during queued admission and just before result delivery;
  late delivery cannot revive a cancelled generation. Preserve separate attempts.
- Either admitted peer EOF or process death fences both roles; actual socket
  shutdown wakes a blocked reader with bounded test wait. Never count only a
  coordinator-local receipt Drop as proof of remote EOF handling.
- Socket clone/credential/identity/poll failure paths do not leak ownership or
  admit peers; asymmetric child signal/wait failures retain A cleanup guarantees.
- Full A pair/owner/adapter suites, strict scoped Clippy, read-only lock parity,
  final actual-key TMUX after formatting. Unsupported-kernel negative remains
  explicit. No generic capability/PF20 or whole-product acceptance inferred.

## Review and functional applicability

Request the usual scoped AstraHigh + Fable5.1High Corbanu/TMUX extension for
new B source only after final proof; A's clean reviews28/29 are not rerun or reset.
Further source changes follow the normal finding classification/convergence rule.
This remains an internal synthetic boundary; request exact increment-only N/A
under accepted policy1.7, with later protected-user/PF26 independent isolated
functional execution still mandatory. Manager owns receiving acceptance and
portable functional harness. No new product workstream or human decision asked.
