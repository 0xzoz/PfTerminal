# Linux service construction and qualification boundary

Historical September 4 boundary. PF20's controller has since landed, but this
service still has no production bootstrap wiring. See the [resumed record](resume-20260911/README.md);
the original gap analysis below is preserved, not a claim that PF20 is still absent.

This record separates executable construction from protected deployment. The
new composition crate links the broker, typed Vault backend and PF-41 journal
without a dependency cycle. `TrustedSession` consumes an owned socket, expected
native peer, binding, MAC and expiring grants; the runtime also requires the
existing `ProtectedModeAuthorization`. None is a worker-deserialized setup API.

The normal `codex-secret-broker-service` binary still exits 78. The separately
named `codex-secret-broker-service-fixture` is built only from the test-only
`codex-secret-broker-fixture` package and requires an explicit fixture
argument. It uses only a newly created synthetic Vault, mock keyring, volatile
test integrity root and fixed receipt
transport. Its inherited socket-pair peer is the parent that created the pair,
not the child's post-exec PID. Native peer checks do not prove process isolation.

## Exact missing code boundary

Repository inspection finds `IntegrityRootStore` implementations only in test
fixtures. PF-20's production protected-root owner must supply a durable native
adapter and its authenticated bootstrap handle. A same-user JSON/file root is
not an acceptable replacement. The new service accepts the preconstructed
PF-41 journal adapter; constructing it from untrusted claims is not implemented.
An authenticated native launcher must also supply the validated platform report,
per-boot key, live grants and connected socket. Installing the default exit-78
binary as a system service does not solve either missing adapter.

The coordinator assigned the native durable anchor to PF-20 ownership. The
broker consumer requires these concrete guarantees and fault cases:

- `load() == None` only for an independently controller-authorized first
  installation. Missing, deleted, inaccessible or wrong-key prior state denies;
  it must never be mistaken for a new empty journal.
- `compare_and_store(expected, next)` must compare the exact trusted checkpoint
  and return success only after durable storage. Concurrent/stale checkpoints,
  partial writes, disk-full, permission loss and sync failure must not yield a
  dispatch permit; ambiguous commits require explicit reconciliation.
- Restart after an acknowledged root write must recover that root. Rollback,
  tampering and root/journal disagreement must be detected, not overwritten
  with a fresh root. Pending dispatches remain non-replayable until the existing
  PF-41 recovery procedure resolves them as unknown.
- The genuine agent UID/process must be unable to read or rewrite the root,
  Vault state, MAC bootstrap material and protected configuration, including
  through inherited handles, retained endpoints or process-debug interfaces.
- Native bootstrap must bind the expected peer and run identity to the actual
  launched process, use a fresh per-boot/channel key and fresh validated platform
  evidence, and reject stale grants/handles after broker death or replacement.
  An inherited socket pair's creator identity alone does not prove child PID
  identity. No worker-supplied report may assert that these checks passed.

An already-open File handle alone establishes none of the ownership,
first-install, nonrollback or durable-CAS guarantees; no such substitute is
implemented in this closeout.

## Minimal proposed privileged setup, requiring separate approval

After those code adapters exist, first qualify only synthetic data on the RTX
host. Proposed reversible targets are:

- Create a dedicated non-login `corbanu-broker-test` system principal and a
  separate non-login `corbanu-worker-test` principal, after verifying neither
  name exists. No existing account or group membership is modified.
- Create only `/var/lib/corbanu-broker-test` for broker-owned synthetic Vault,
  journal and integrity state, and `/run/corbanu-broker-test` for native sockets;
  set narrowly scoped ownership and permissions on these new directories only.
- Install one clearly test-named systemd service and socket unit with explicit
  UID, executable, inherited-handle contract, restricted filesystem/network
  access and process-debug restrictions; keep original production services
  untouched. Record exact unit contents and native capability results before
  claiming any protection.
- Launch the real untrusted test worker separately and probe denial of Vault,
  root, config, memory/debug, inherited handles and unauthorized socket access.
  Verify service restart, generation replacement and live revocation using
  synthetic credentials. Stop/disable test units and preserve evidence on exit.

No principal creation, service installation, ownership/ACL changes or real Vault
transfer has been performed. Per-request streaming, cached TLS handlers, upload
cancellation, response filtering, macOS and Windows isolation are still separate
mandatory gates. This construction stage cannot enable protected activation.
