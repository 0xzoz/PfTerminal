# Broker service construction checkpoint

Historical September 4 checkpoint. The [September 11 resume](resume-20260911/README.md)
supersedes current source/test coordinates and records the newly approved sixth
Fable review. Original evidence and the then-exhausted budget below are preserved.

Status: scoped construction, remote tests and Astra High review passed; fresh
Fable service-stage review awaits budget authorization. PF-27-S04 stays `in_progress`. Allocation `db141e9cb`;
formatted source checkpoint `6bdc84195` is pushed on `feat/security-round5-broker`
and mirrored cleanly on the authorized RTX host. No production service or
protected eligibility is claimed.

The new crate composes the actual typed Vault backend and PF-41 journal adapter
with broker runtime state. It consumes trusted, process-owned session objects
and independently expected native peer identity. Default execution remains
unavailable (exit 78), while a separate optional synthetic fixture exercises
subprocess dispatch, journal settlement, death/restart, old-key/replay denial,
wrong-peer rejection and native signal interruption. The actual six-test
subprocess suite passed. EINTR retries preserve the existing absolute deadline.

## Registration and exact final checks

The coordinator registered the workspace member/dependency in `2a6cfb3d0` and
delegated only service-caused lock deltas. Cargo added one 17-line service
package entry; Bazel lock update and check both passed with no MODULE delta.
The persistent Bazel server shut down normally before releasing the build lock.

Executed remotely after scoped fix and full formatting, serialized under the
round's build lock with fresh `service-tmp.Qj3cCA` beneath the broker evidence
root (not the previously contaminated shared TMPDIR):

1. Affected `just fix`, then `just fmt`: passed; exact scoped changes imported.
2. `just test -p codex-secret-broker-service`: **1/1** default-denial test passed.
3. `just test -p codex-secret-broker-service --features synthetic-fixture`
   **6/6** actual subprocess construction tests passed.
4. Full affected broker/Vault/proxy suites: **338/338**. Focused Core
   broker-client/config tests: **6/6**, with 2387 unrelated tests filtered out.
5. Cargo/Bazel parity passed; governance passed (2 active plans, 58 current and
   114 archived sprints).

Earlier development runs diagnosed an absent `Default` runtime configuration
and missing Nix `process` feature; both were fixed before final tests. Test
Clippy emitted unwrap-use warnings; the final fix command exited successfully.

Both binaries were rebuilt with `--locked` at the exact source and copied while
holding the build lock to

Four prior reviews remain recorded without resetting the ledger. Review **5,
Astra High**, completed against `db141e9cb..6ca940226` after immutable source and
evidence pinning. The structured helper exited **0** with no accepted/actionable
findings. It confirmed trusted peer checks precede registration, runtime and
transport guards preserve cancellation/replay denial, EINTR preserves the
absolute deadline, and synthetic execution stays feature-gated while production
exits 78. Outputs are `service-astra-5.{txt,json}`. Route: Python autoreview
helper, app-bundled Codex CLI 0.153.1, `--model gpt-6-astra --thinking high`,
`--mode branch --base db141e9cb`; no nested reviewer or local build.

Five of five currently authorized invocations are consumed. No redundant clean
review was run. A sixth invocation is not authorized; fresh Fable service-stage
coverage awaits the user's budget decision. Existing Fable review 4 covers the
earlier broker stage, not this subsequent service construction.

See `service-qualification-boundary.md` for the absent production integrity-root
adapter, native bootstrap/privileged setup boundary and unimplemented streaming
and all-OS gates. No production credentials, principal creation, installation,
ownership changes or protected activation were used or claimed.
