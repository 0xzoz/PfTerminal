# Qualified source checkpoint

September 12, 2026 06:06 UTC. All stage tests/reviews finished. Do not repeat them.

- Runtime commit `bd70f0e6b561c5ade88b3c6f8a87ebd7b937e5f3` on the same owned
  branch. Manager PF35 documentation is preserved at `f2e6d77e4`.
- Local/RTX Rust tree `a940e60257f23bf7ecffddec234afa135522ada6`.
- RTX worktree `/home/travis/worktrees/security-broker-child-admission-20260912`
  contains the same staged source; previous RTX resume worktree is untouched.
- New stage final proof: strict Clippy, parity, default 3, synthetic 13, affected
  338, build and TMUX 13 + production exit78 passed; see `rtx-portable/`.
  Keep initial passing and transient-failure evidence, too.
- Review 7 Astra High exited 1 with two accepted in-scope findings, repaired and
  tested; original outputs are here. Review 8 Fable found only a test-portability
  issue, now repaired and retested. Review 9 Fable High completed with helper
  exit0, no findings. Thread `01a09436-777b-7170-981e-b348c2bab214`; original
  outputs and verified dispositions are retained here. No further review needed.
- Three new slots used, two remain in the current six-hour window. Consult
  `../review-budget.md`; historical six reviews remain spent.

Source and evidence are committed and pushed. The manager confirmed the main
push window is clear; root owns the already-authorized landing. Use current Git
refs and the monitor's verified handoff for the final receiving SHA. Always
fetch and coordinate any later main writes with manager task
`01a08522-76a1-7ad1-afe6-ad690d55c0d7`; do not redo a completed landing.

The subsequent existing-root composition step is now qualified at `794080a4f`;
[its current handoff](../root-composition-20260912/CURRENT.md) supersedes this
earlier next-step instruction. Five review slots used in the current window.
This admission library is not a root launcher; the historical v2
installation proposal is not executable authority. No root listener, accounts,
services, ACL/ownership changes, TPM changes, real Vault migration or protected
activation without the separate exact-manifest approval. PF27 remains in progress.
