# PF27 review allowance

Travis authorized: “You get 5 more review slots. Reset review slots every 6 hours.”
Recorded at **2026-09-12 05:25:45 UTC** (September 11, 22:25:45 Phoenix).

- Scope: this PF27 workstream; other lanes' historical budgets are unchanged.
- Five additional passes are available immediately. Replenish to five at each
  six-hour boundary anchored to the timestamp above; unused slots do not accrue.
- First reset: **2026-09-12 11:25:45 UTC** (04:25:45 Phoenix), then every six hours.
- Count a review at dispatch, including failed/interrupted requests. Preserve its
  timestamp, model, scope, evidence and outcome. Never erase historical reviews
  or restart review numbering when the allowance replenishes.
- At each dispatch, compute the active window and subtract reviews dispatched
  in that window. Reserve the slot before starting; root serializes dispatches.
- This is a ceiling, not a target. No unnecessary reviews, duplicate clean
  passes, or waiting for a reset merely to evade unresolved findings.
- No privileged installation or scope expansion is authorized by this allowance.

## Integrator extension — September 12, 08:43 UTC

Manager task `01a08522-76a1-7ad1-afe6-ad690d55c0d7` relayed Travis's explicit
policy amendment permitting integrator-authorized additional reviews and granted
**two scoped passes now** for the frozen probe: Astra12 and required Fable13.
This is **+2**, not a reset: the five scheduled-window passes above remain spent.
The six-hour replenishment anchor and all historical outcomes are unchanged.
No new scope, native installation, activation or release authority is granted.
Avoid further opinions once no substantive findings remain; proceed to integration.

Extension accounting: **2 used / 0 available**. Both processes finished.
Do not silently retry or erase the nonzero Fable result. The portability
disposition and integration checkpoint are in probe-20260912/README.md.

## Next launcher stage — additional integrator allowance

After verified main `3e8bf6c95`, manager task
`01a08522-76a1-7ad1-afe6-ad690d55c0d7` explicitly authorized **up to3 additional
necessary scoped design/code/evidence passes** for the next launcher allocation
without waiting for11:25Z. This is a separate +3 extension, not a reset of the
five scheduled passes or the consumed +2 extension. No installation authority.

Scope: [launcher recipe/identity preparation](launcher-next-20260912.md).
**3 used / 0 available**; review14 dispatched09:15Z, review15 dispatched09:16Z;
the remaining contingency is reserved for static-build evidence review20 below. Prefer
the required Astra High and Fable5.1High closeout, keeping the third for a
concrete repair/evidence need. Do not spend a pass just because it is available.

manifest-next-20260912.md and authorized TWO necessary new-stage passes:
Astra High and Fable5.1High via Corbanu/TMUX. **2 used / 0 available**.
The prior unused contingency is retained separately; reviews1–15 and the
scheduled six-hour anchor are unchanged. Reserve each dispatch before starting.
No root-positive execution, installation or main-write window is granted.

Astra High and Fable5.1High Corbanu/TMUX. **2 used / 0 available**.

## Static probe — use the existing contingency once

The receiving owner assigned the one remaining launcher-stage contingency to
one build/linkage evidence check, not another unchanged-Rust review. Reviews1–19,
extensions and scheduled window history are preserved. No additional slot or
early six-hour reset is introduced; the next scheduled replenishment is11:25:45Z.

## Sealed-byte ELF profile — new-parser extension

Receiving owner accepted runtime-elf-next-20260912.md and authorized +2 necessary
source/security closeout passes: Astra High21 and Fable5.1High22 through existing
review tooling/private TMUX. **2 used / 0 available**, September12 11:35Z dispatch.
Review21 Astra High uses the established Codex helper; review22 Fable5.1High
uses the established Corbanu wrapper. Both inspect new parser Rust9033b2ed over97d.
Originals under runtime-elf-20260912: Astra21 exit0/findings[]; Fable22 exit1,
patch correct, sole P3 independently isolate dynamic-tag rejection tests.
Test-only12-line correction635655c34 retains runtime unchanged; rerun in repaired/.
Manager accepted direct evidence disposition after rerun, no extra review.
History1–20, spent old contingency, six-hour anchor and scheduled replenishment
are unchanged. This extension is not a reset or permission for unchanged reviews.
