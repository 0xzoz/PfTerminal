# Review disposition (Opus 5.5 High)

## Round 1: request changes

| # | Severity | Disposition |
| - | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | High | Fixed. The commit goes through the policy tree that holds the picker's session thread (`live_controller(home, thread)`), not the strictest tree. Choosing the level already in force now raises the other trees of the process that are below it. A downgrade's revocation ends grants in this session only, and the review says so. Tests: `security_transition_stricter_level_applies_to_the_live_session_now` (reaches the other tree) and `..._permissive_lowers_a_stricter_record_saved_elsewhere`. |
| 2 | Medium | Fixed. When the saved Core record is stricter than this session, the session takes it first, so choosing Permissive is a downgrade that lowers the record. `confirm::run` also fails and restores the files whenever Core keeps a different level for the next start. |
| 3 | Medium | Partly fixed. The Aggressive lock is released before restarting (`Mutex<Option<File>>`). Still open: on Windows the parent process doesn't ignore Ctrl-C while it waits for the restarted child. |
| 4 | Medium | Fixed. The basis records whether the session's tree runs in this process. Without it, the review says the change applies "from the next start". |
| 5 | Low/Medium | Fixed. Only an Aggressive record or corrupt content counts as tampering. A record that can't be read (for example inside a sandbox) is treated like a missing one. The repair hint works with the flag off, because a stored non-Permissive level turns the picker on. |
| 6 | Low | Fixed. `security_confirm.lock` is held across snapshot, save, commit and restore, with a 2 s wait. |
| 7 | Low | Fixed. `LevelBasis` carries the tree's `AuthorityEpoch`, so any commit after the review makes the review stale. Test: `security_transition_review_is_bound_to_the_tree_epoch`. |
| 8 | Low | Fixed. Both paths read the kill switch from the revocation state. |
| 9 | Low | Fixed in round 2 (see below). The round-1 fix, and its claim that the TUI has no image argument, were wrong. |
| 10 | Low | Partly fixed. The Permissive review says when `config.toml` will be rewritten. Still open: a profile-v2 user config path is neither read nor edited. This errs strict: the next start keeps the stricter level, and the next-start line can be wrong in that direction. |

## Round 2: request changes

| # | Severity | Disposition |
| - | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Medium | Fixed. Restart arguments are no longer edited. The new process gets every argument unchanged and `CORBANU_RESTARTED_FOR_SECURITY=1`, so the TUI drops its initial prompt and images (`run_main`). Test: `security_confirm_restart_keeps_every_argument_and_marks_the_process`. Since round 3 the marker is removed at process entry, so no child process inherits it. |
| 2 | Low/Medium | Fixed with the reviewer's better fix. `catch_up` is gone. `prepare_reviewed_transition` takes the stored level the person reviewed: a choice below it is a downgrade of the saved record, and only a stored level above it counts as `StoredLevelChanged`. The session isn't raised. The review says "the Core level saved for the next start becomes Permissive … this session stays Permissive". |
| 3 | Low/Medium | Fixed. `propagate` tells a tree's sinks whenever its level rose, including on `Unchanged`. When the session is already Aggressive, the review says so and makes no promise about this session's approvals. Test: `security_transition_unchanged_raise_notifies_the_other_sessions`. |
| 4 | Low | Fixed. A live session's request uses the reviewed `AuthorityEpoch`, and a moved epoch maps to "review it again". |
| 5 | Process | `origin/main` was merged into the branch and the tests were run again. |

## Round 3: approve with fixes

| # | Severity | Disposition |
| - | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Low/Medium | Fixed. A `Downgrade` always sets the next-start level. The mismatch message says what Core saved instead of "Nothing changed". Test: `security_transition_downgrade_of_the_record_sets_the_next_start`. |
| 2 | Low | Fixed. The downgrade wording (grants end, "saved by another session") appears only when the saved record is stricter than Permissive. Otherwise the review says the record is set or repaired to Permissive and makes no promise about grants. |
| 3 | Low | Fixed. `take_restart_marker()` reads and removes the variable at process entry, in both `corbanu` and `codex-tui`, before any thread starts. |
| 4 | Info | Fixed. For a reviewed transition the floor is the stored level that was reviewed (Permissive when absent or unreadable). `prepare_transition` keeps "the level in force" as its floor. |

## Round 4: approve

| # | Severity | Disposition |
| - | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Info | Fixed: the message now says "the previous level file was put back". |
| 2 | Info | Not added. The two branches need a live policy tree, which TUI tests cannot build (`LevelBasis` can only be read from Core). Core covers the commit kinds behind them: `..._permissive_lowers_a_stricter_record_saved_elsewhere` (downgrade, saved by another session) and `..._a_confirmed_level_repairs_an_unreadable_state`. |
