# PF-21-S02 candidate evidence

## Candidate and scope

- Dispatch base: `77f56da1ecddf6093184280b541339e1869ca7b3`.
- Branch/worktree: `feat/p0-security-compatibility-drift` at
  `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/p0-security-compatibility-drift`.
- Contract: expanded Permissive compatibility schema version 2; the accepted
  PF-21-S01 oracle remains schema version 1 and byte-identical at SHA-256
  `45d1f2bd96733381638bb62961ee59fb1c026bc05a6a78d03b560cb794406b8d`.
- No Rust/runtime, manifest, lock, active plan, sprint index, MkDocs, archive,
  or other sprint path changed.

## Controls and executable inventory

- Accepted pre-feature baseline:
  `3c1b2f6cbe11657ff4e3b72b11db029c9e7a92eb`.
- Genuinely different, buildable upstream-aligned 0.1.34 source control:
  `af5a4e39b590e7517120fd935ccfac8cbf7cf131`. Its `codex-rs` tree
  `9d36bc6b6694d1043b0b75bc13d0e0c0eb5473c9` differs from baseline tree
  `730cdac4e3a14a5ac494b6a80c13b1e1204ac650`; it descends from convergence
  commit `45a60f03d2f6c041d284b41cc3f33c416d9eeed1` and upstream Codex parent
  `413492cd6c3a4d4f8dff6f406247ccda5a9d88aa`.
- Nine inherited compatibility cases execute on upstream, baseline, and
  candidate. Four additional candidate-only protected-boundary cases are pinned
  to the pre-candidate dispatch base and directly execute
  `codex-secret-broker`, `codex-network-proxy`, `codex-browser-isolation`, and
  `codex-content-security`. The five immutable S01 probes remain unchanged.
- The four protected cases verify platform eligibility rejection, explicit
  credential-injection opt-in, Permissive browser-inactivity, and current-verdict
  screening. They do not substitute for PF-26 live-repository qualification.

## First independent review and remediation

The first read-only review used real TMUX session `pf27-opus5-g1-review` with
Corbanu Terminal and `claude-opus-5-plan` at `max`. It found coverage and harness
hardening issues; it was not a clean verdict. The complete recovered response is
stored outside the repository at
`/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/p0-security-compatibility-drift/tmux-review/pf21-opus-review-final-full.txt`.

Remediation adds direct security-crate cases, replaces the Rust-identical
upstream release with the convergence source, exercises every drift-ledger
branch, caps review freshness in code, distinguishes command/contract crashes,
hashes all tracked execution recipe inputs, rejects in-worktree artifacts,
prunes stale control targets, preserves primary errors through cleanup, removes
per-run detached sources, and uses a test-anchored lexical Rust extractor.

A second read-only review in the same authenticated TMUX/Corbanu/Opus 5 Plan
max session found seven residual harness/evidence issues. Commit
`a6e933b03a91e16e9642f9ce996a52dff5719a3e` fixes all seven: preparation tests
inject a fixed review time; cleanup retries cannot suppress otherwise complete
evidence and are recorded as warnings; bounded captures preserve both head and
tail; stale-target iteration is snapshotted; immutable-probe wording is exact;
the shared-plan CLI integration action is explicit; and only `Exception` is
captured by the contract-error path. The findings transcript is outside the
repository at `tmux-review/remediation-review-findings-transcript.txt`, SHA-256
`da2c8c88217b4a7d2c731249ee36c3a6dc06de1e3d9008c74e1df7fa0003467b`.

## Remediated deterministic verification

- Clean implementation commit:
  `a6e933b03a91e16e9642f9ce996a52dff5719a3e`. The generated report records that
  exact source commit, an empty `source_dirty_paths` array and
  `candidate_runtime_tree: clean`.
- Exact command (run from the allocated worktree):

  ```sh
  python3 scripts/security-level-compat \
    --baseline 3c1b2f6cbe11657ff4e3b72b11db029c9e7a92eb \
    --upstream af5a4e39b590e7517120fd935ccfac8cbf7cf131 \
    --candidate /Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/p0-security-compatibility-drift/candidate-target/debug/corbanu \
    --cache-root /Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/p0-security-compatibility-drift/cache \
    --temp-root /Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/p0-security-compatibility-drift/tmp \
    --output /Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/p0-security-compatibility-drift/full-run-6
  ```

- Result: PASS, 36/36 exact tests: nine inherited cases on each of baseline,
  upstream and candidate (27), four candidate-only protected cases, and five
  immutable S01 probes. Every recorded command executed exactly one test.
- Report:

- The harness removed its detached per-run source root (`run_root: null`),
  recorded an empty `cleanup_warnings` array, and retained only the two bounded
  control targets. The report and all build, cache and temporary artifacts live
  on `CorbanuDrive` outside the worktree.

  `ruff check scripts/security_level_compat.py scripts/test_security_level_compat.py`,
  and `python3 -m unittest scripts.test_security_level_compat -v` pass; the
  self-test result is 37/37. Governance, immutable-oracle, diff and scope
  checks are rerun after the final review evidence is recorded.

## TMUX evidence and final independent review

- Supporting real-candidate TMUX `/status` and clean-exit smoke artifacts:
  `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/p0-security-compatibility-drift/tmux-smoke/status-pane.txt`
  (SHA-256
  `17a09ef7fb46d24dd1f296dae32a10d5985f94868e688148cb2cc4fb656ae9ef`)
  and `tmux-smoke/logs/codex-tui.log` (SHA-256
  `3194fb4857b6083f09896a3ef97e7a67b2c0b4389d1ea28b79fbbfc1eb0a6162`).
- Final read-only review ran in authenticated real TMUX session
  `pf27-opus5-g1-review` using Corbanu Terminal v0.1.35 with exact model
  `claude-opus-5-plan` at `max` effort. It reviewed evidence commit
  `ea3c63846`, implementation commit
  `a6e933b03a91e16e9642f9ce996a52dff5719a3e`, and the full diff from dispatch
  base `77f56da1ecddf6093184280b541339e1869ca7b3`; it independently searched for
  additional live callers and returned the exact verdict `NO FINDINGS`.

The earlier 32-test report is superseded by the clean-source 36/36 report
above and is not final evidence.

The integration owner still must merge after PF-19/PF-20, rerun the combined
tree, update every pre-S02 caller to supply the now-required
`--upstream <commit>` argument, update shared navigation, and archive PF-21-S02.
The four exact out-of-scope call sites are:

- `docs/plans/active/p0-security-levels.md:752` (release-gate command);
- `scripts/test_security_level_evidence.py:23-31` (sibling discovered test); and
- `qa/security-levels/fixtures/README.md:48-49` (`--prepare` operator runbook); and
- `docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-26-s04-final-automated-qualification.md:67`
  (final qualification checklist).

The third read-only review identified this incomplete handback as its sole
finding; its transcript is outside the repository at
`tmux-review/final-review-one-finding-transcript.txt`, SHA-256
`74bb69180b854c83ece3ac12145127a3dac57a9ca0c0f2c459a34240850cc5a2`.
The fourth read-only review identified the omitted final-qualification caller
as its sole finding; its transcript is outside the repository at
`tmux-review/fourth-review-one-finding-transcript.txt`, SHA-256
`7982da1cc02fe8e22156154f700cfaad978168a36c2fd6484565fb6266b968d0`.
This lane does not edit those shared/out-of-scope surfaces.

## Integration result

The integration owner merged the lane at `c02568c71` and updated all four shared
callers at `c8ada313d`. The final merged-source compatibility run passed 36/36
with `source_commit: c8ada313db6dc7cfade42d886db2758900113f4c`, an empty
`source_dirty_paths` array, `candidate_runtime_tree: clean`, zero accepted drift,
no cleanup warnings, and no retained per-run source root. Report:
`/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/round2-final/compatibility-final/compatibility-report.json`,
SHA-256 `eecca72703bfc6d1667c77645d836fa03d2e6b2bfe60709bbfbfbaad90549e44`.

The final merged Corbanu binary also passed a real TMUX `/status` and clean-exit
smoke. Status capture SHA-256:
`1a8c0d064c190daf3f3e3fce63c397b2ae617dac2dafd98864b8c8f570656ac9`;
