# PF-34-S04 lane evidence

Date: 2026-08-30. Status: **registered combined tree accepted and sprint
completed**.

Product citations:

- **Reconciled security scope — TO BUILD** — “Unknown or unsupported protected
  paths fail visibly rather than falling back to raw secrets or unscreened
  execution.”
- **Non-negotiable controls** — “Classify instruction intent and provenance
  before external content can influence tools or financial actions.”

- Cache root: `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/p0-security-ingress-classifier/`
- Product TUI applicability: none; this remains a pure, unconsumed preparation
  boundary. The mandated independent review itself ran through TMUX and the
  rebased Corbanu Terminal true TUI.

Under the transferred integration authority, the lane also registered the
crate, Cargo/Bazel resources and lock state, and recurring three-platform CI.
No consumer dependency, Core/TUI/provider adapter, profile activation, or
runtime route was added. The exact recipe and outcomes are retained in
[`registration-handback.md`](registration-handback.md).

## Delivered invariants

- Exact contract/source/raw/rendered/sanitized/reassembly and segment bindings.
- Exact classifier artifact and threshold configuration identity.
- One-shot full-content release; progress exposes counters but never bytes.
- Typed allow/suspicious/hostile/unavailable decisions with safe diagnostics.
- Sticky malformed, duplicate, partial, digest/version/source/transformation,
  model/threshold, cancellation, timeout, stale/future verdict and resource
  failures; later forced allow cannot recover a failed session.
- Released bytes remain `untrusted` and carry `authority: none`.
- Byte-bearing `Debug` output exposes only byte length and SHA-256; it cannot
  bypass the explicit `into_raw_untrusted` audit token or log hostile payloads.
- Seven synthetic fixture files cover benign transformation, a cross-segment
  hostile instruction, and quarantine transitions. The verifier binds the
  complete inventory, hashes, source/transformation/reassembly identities,
  boundaries, fixture-only verdict identity, taint and forbidden transitions.

This does not activate protected ingestion, qualify a detector, grant fixture
authority, clear taint, or make corpus/model/CPU/offline/signing/distribution
claims owned by PF-35-S01/S02.

## Lane-local verification

The exact files were compiled through an isolated Cargo harness because shared
crate registration is G1-owned. The final candidate used `CARGO_HOME`,
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `TMPDIR`, `UV_CACHE_DIR`, and `PIP_CACHE_DIR` beneath the
recorded cache root.

## Immutable identities

- Contract/schema: `1` / `1`
- Manifest SHA-256: `7e8a4850f67052b2b5b2e0d17f5227116f226c65ee25a6945d04ff7a2a1a1fc3`
- Contract SHA-256: `586acc231f3db2bfc426b14fc6ff51e9f47690333aabe10c86b24045b3261fef`
- Contract tests SHA-256: `c1e5460b490e9eb407673b89eb573f8c057262cb07f0b655684514b09754de49`
- Third full review packet SHA-256: `3813e9783ddbf09fb9e2bdbb16fa9600adeb62b58fcd09385bf6328089bc3389`
- Final evidence-confirmation packet SHA-256: `9753a4b8046359e0c3e6e385fa86770fde692312f3a8c87e9ffd3a979c34ecca`
- Integration review packet SHA-256: `5ebbb39bbea56a3cc69549f6239e7346e627584d5b261e4dee556d87c5c1c8f4`

The final-tree contract-test digest includes the downstream PF-35-S01
model/artifact/threshold mismatch regression appended during round-three
integration; the PF-34 contract implementation and its existing assertions are
unchanged. The lane ledger is refreshed so recurring CI seals the combined tree
rather than the pre-integration test file.

## Supplemental structured review

Command: repository Autoreview, branch mode from the original pre-rebase
allocation lineage, Codex `gpt-5.5`, high reasoning, web search disabled. Its
raw artifacts preserve pre-rebase commit IDs; the equivalent current allocation
is `6a614e8afa825267b329b3274fd3cba648e99151`. The reviewer found four P2 defects over three
cycles: unfrozen expected verdicts, unfrozen quarantine semantics, traversal and
undeclared-object defects in the JSON Schema, and eager/reassembly allocation
exhaustion. All were verified as in-scope, fixed, and covered by regression
tests or schema validation. The final full-branch rerun reports no findings and
`patch is correct` at confidence 0.84: [text](autoreview.txt),
[structured result](autoreview.json).

## Mandated independent review

The review ran in TMUX through the rebased Corbanu Terminal with provider
`claude-plan`, route `claude-opus-5-plan` (provider-reported Claude Opus 5.0),
and reasoning effort `max`. Four checksum-verified immutable packets produced:

1. 3 P1 / 7 P2 / 16 P3, all lane findings remediated or correctly accepted at G1.
2. 0 P1 / 4 P2 / 12 P3, all four P2 findings remediated.
3. 0 P1 / 1 P2 / 4 P3; the contract, fixtures, verifier, handback, and scope
   exception were accepted, with stale evidence as the sole P2.
4. **clean**, with N-5 resolved and 0 new P0/P1/P2.
5. G1/G2 integration review: **changes-required**, with 0 P0, 0 P1, 1 P2
   and 7 P3. Registration, Bazel parity, public API, locks, CI, and the
   behavior-preserving hex rewrite were accepted. The sole P2 was the stale
   lane ledger and evidence after that rewrite; the ledger, guard, workflow,
   dedicated known-answer test, and explicit no-unsafe policy were remediated.
6. Integration remediation follow-up: **clean**, with 0 P0/P1/P2 and 5
   non-blocking P3 observations. Packet SHA-256:
   `dec900c90c5b7a0e649eef942b4dda12f605f0bc751aa708036102067188d829`.

The complete runtime attestation, packet hashes, dispositions, and transient
artifact hashes are recorded in
[`claude-opus-5-max-review.md`](claude-opus-5-max-review.md).

## Combined-tree integration

- Cargo membership, crate manifest/public surface, Cargo lock, root fixture
  exports, crate Bazel target and recurring Linux/macOS/Windows workflow are
  registered. The unused workspace dependency alias was removed because
  `cargo shear 1.11.2` correctly rejected a dependency with no consumer.
- The registered combined tree passes `just fix`, `just fmt`, strict Clippy,
  21 focused/full Rust tests (`21 passed, 0 failed`), 14 verifier regressions,
  seven-fixture/schema verification and targeted Bazel/argument-comment
  qualification.
- `bazel test //codex-rs/content-security:all` proves the six `include_bytes!`
  resources reach unit-test compilation. Repository-wide argument-comment
  lint remains red only for two pre-existing `security-policy/src/grant.rs`
  comments outside this scope; targeted content-security lint passes.
- `MODULE.bazel.lock` regenerated byte-identical. `cargo shear` reports no
  PF-34 error; its remaining warnings are pre-existing current-main files
  outside this scope.
- The recurring workflow reruns fixture attributes, verifier, verifier tests,
  the 15-file ledger, narrative consistency guard, and registered Rust tests
  on Linux, macOS and Windows. Existing repository Bazel CI selects
  `//codex-rs/content-security:all`.
- The first final-tree recurring run passed Linux and macOS but exposed Git's
  default CRLF checkout conversion for the `.sha256` ledger on Windows. Root
  attributes now pin every checksum manifest and the sealed content-security
  Rust sources plus classifier evidence JSON inputs to LF, matching the fixture
  byte contract and allowing the ledger and classifier identity checks to
  consume identical paths and bytes on all three platforms.
- Exact final-tree commands and outcomes: [integration qualification](integration-qualification.md).

## Completion

- The checksum-verified follow-up ran through TMUX, Corbanu Terminal and Claude
  Opus 5.0 Max and returned `clean`, explicitly authorizing archive.
- PF-34-S04 is archived with no PF-35 allocation or release claim.

No human or release acceptance is claimed; downstream PF-34/PF-35 consumers and
PF-26 retain those gates.
