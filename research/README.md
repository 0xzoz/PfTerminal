# Research

Internal research artifacts live here rather than in the user-facing MkDocs
tree or release evidence directories. Generated reports stay beside their
source material so local provenance links remain valid.

## Product and security working session

The [`2026-08-23-product-security-session`](2026-08-23-product-security-session/)
packet contains:

- [`repository-guide.html`](2026-08-23-product-security-session/repository-guide.html),
  an onboarding map distilled from the working session and repository docs;
- [`SecurityComparativeAnalysis.html`](2026-08-23-product-security-session/SecurityComparativeAnalysis.html),
  an opinionated comparison of agent-harness security architectures and the
  proposed Corbanu security model;
- [`SecurityComparativeAnalysis.artifact.json`](2026-08-23-product-security-session/SecurityComparativeAnalysis.artifact.json),
  the validated source artifact used to build the portable HTML report; and
- [`Working session - 2026_08_23 11_31 MST - Recording.diarized.md`](2026-08-23-product-security-session/Working%20session%20-%202026_08_23%2011_31%20MST%20-%20Recording.diarized.md),
  the automated diarized transcript. Speaker labels and transcription details
  are machine-generated and should not be treated as identity-confirmed.

## Tmux testing

[`tmux-testing/tmux-testing-report.html`](tmux-testing/tmux-testing-report.html)
is a source-and-design study for a layered TUI test harness. It is research,
not QA evidence: tmux was unavailable on the research workstation, so the
report did not execute the proposed test matrix.

[`tmux-testing/tmuxPlan.html`](tmux-testing/tmuxPlan.html) turns that research
into a bounded engineering work package with functional and non-functional
requirements, implementation stages, required tests, and acceptance gates. It
is the umbrella plan for the completed
[`RW-TMUX-01`](../qa/work-packages/RW-TMUX-01.md) and
[`RW-TMUX-02`](../qa/work-packages/RW-TMUX-02.md) packages and the completed
[`RW-TMUX-03`](../qa/work-packages/RW-TMUX-03.md) package. `RW-TMUX-04` remains
the planned release-matrix adoption increment. These are Routine
execution records, not product sprints or release artifacts.

## Experimental planner

[`experimental-planner/experimentalPlanner.html`](experimental-planner/experimentalPlanner.html)
proposes a LangGraph workflow service with a Danus-inspired evidence and dependency
ledger, using GPU kernel optimization as its first experiment domain. It includes
architecture diagrams, versioned worker contracts and reviewed decomposition inspired
by Choir, data models, admission and recovery algorithms, checker
qualification, measurement policy, and twelve phased sprint packages. This is an
internal research/design artifact; its implementation sprints and GPU qualification
remain proposed, and it does not authorize or report completed product work.

## Research tools

[`tools/diarize_recording.py`](tools/diarize_recording.py) produced the working
session transcript using MLX Whisper, SpeechBrain, PyTorch, SoundFile, NumPy,
and scikit-learn. Those optional, platform-heavy dependencies are intentionally
not part of the repository's locked general-purpose `scripts` environment.
