# /orchestrate persistent supervision

## The pain

A worker pane can exist and still stall, lose direction, or finish without
review. Corbanu Terminal can attach a durable Manager-to-Worker assignment so
progress checks, handoffs, pauses, and recovery remain visible instead of
depending on one chat turn.

| Exact product-spec heading | **Shipping MVP — LIVE** |
| Requirement excerpt | “Agent orchestration: Sauron → Nazgul → Troll → Orc orchestration, model-aware delegation, durable mailboxes, supervision, resume, and recovery.” |

## What /orchestrate does

`/orchestrate` attaches persistent supervision to an existing Corbanu
Terminal, Claude Code, or managed worker pane. It creates and manages the
assignment; it does not create the worker hierarchy.

Use the related commands for different jobs:

| Command | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `/panes` | Create or switch user panes and inspect managed crew panes. |
| `/spawn` | Create or bind the Nazgul, Troll, and Orc hierarchy. |
| `/orchestrate` | Assign a Manager to keep driving an existing Worker. |
| `/agent` | Switch the active native agent thread. |

## Start an assignment

For the shortest guided flow, run:

```text
/orchestrate
```

Choose the Worker, choose or create its Manager, and confirm the visible
assignment. For the full guided flow—including duration and standing
instructions—run:

```text
/orchestrate attach
```

The full flow asks for:

1. the existing Worker pane;
2. a duration;
3. an assignment specification;
4. an existing or newly created Manager pane; and
5. final confirmation of the Manager → Worker relationship.

A Manager cannot also be its own Worker. Corbanu Terminal Main remains the
human control surface and is not used as an assignment Manager.

## Inspect and control assignments

Run:

```text
/orchestrate status
```

The status view shows each Manager → Worker relationship, assignment phase,
expiry, latest dispatch, and specification. Open an assignment to use the
guided controls, or use the repeatable commands below.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/orchestrate pause <id>` | Stop automatic supervision without deleting the assignment. |
| `/orchestrate resume <id>` | Re-arm a paused assignment. |
| `/orchestrate extend <id> <duration>` | Add time to its current expiry. |
| `/orchestrate fire <id>` | Send the next Manager mandate immediately; it does not terminate the Worker. |
| `/orchestrate test <id>` | Preview the next mandate without sending it. |
| `/orchestrate detach <id|target>` | End the assignment while leaving its panes and crew intact. |

Advanced inline attachment is also available:

```text
/orchestrate attach <target> <whip-name> [--mode review|auto] \
  [--for 4h|--until HH:MM|--for unlimited] \
  [--max N] [--cooldown S] [--holder me|none]
```

Prefer the guided flow unless repeatable automation requires inline syntax.

While the security kill switch is on, every armed assignment and whip is
paused. Turning the switch off does not resume them; run
`/orchestrate resume <id>` for each one you want running again.

## Persistence and recovery

Assignments are retained with the pane layout. After switching panes or
restarting Corbanu Terminal, use `/orchestrate status` to confirm the
authoritative assignment state before creating a replacement. If a Manager or
Worker becomes unreachable, preserve the panes and inspect the visible error;
do not treat context compaction as a dead worker.

Pausing, detaching, or expiring an assignment changes supervision only. It does
not archive a pane, delete an agent thread, stop every background terminal, or
remove the managed `/spawn` crew.
