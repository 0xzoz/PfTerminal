# Security source reconciliation — 2026-08-28

Planning evidence for the active [P0 `/security` plan](completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md), not shipped-feature documentation or execution proof.

## Decision and scope

Travis Good's 2026-08-28 instruction adopts **Permissive compatibility and mandatory brokered protection above Permissive**, and asks for a complete reconciled sprint sequence with OpenClaw as the primary implementation reference. This supersedes the comparison's “all modes” no-raw-secret wording and the historical child/container raw-secret injection proposal. Permissive retains existing policies; it does not mean disabling existing sandbox/approval controls.

The active plan owns the merged work. The earlier firewall proposal remains historical design input, not a second implementation authority. The inventory contains **72 cancelled firewall sprints**, not 75. All 72 remain untouched; the 23 current security records are retained/reconciled and **40 new records** produced the 63-sprint review snapshot. The subsequent
[accepted architecture refinement](security-architecture-refinements-2026-08-28.md)
added five preparation/foundation units to the historical **68-record snapshot**.
[Upstream reconciliation](security-upstream-reconciliation-2026-08-28.md) now preserves
nine completed archives and adds five narrow follow-ups: **64 current plus nine
completed sprints**. The 72 cancelled-record dispositions and seven unrelated
Autoreview drafts remain unchanged. Completion applies only to each archive's
original scope, not to stronger review requirements.

## OpenClaw implementation reference

Current adoption reference: [OpenClaw `13adff02ca3897768d80d2bca18f5acf08c55d91`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/tree/13adff02ca3897768d80d2bca18f5acf08c55d91), the default-branch tip downloaded on 2026-08-28. The older `6ce272c2a662f81b7779507335d91de4d61c589b` remains A1's historical baseline, not the current reference. [MIT license](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/13adff02ca3897768d80d2bca18f5acf08c55d91/LICENSE) applies; preserve notices for future adaptation. No upstream implementation is copied by this planning change.

The [direct source review](openclaw-source-review-2026-08-28.md) records named functions, callers, defaults, deliberate differences, test execution and unreviewed areas. It corrects the earlier incomplete memory/taint account. **This is a targeted security-path review, not an entire-codebase audit or platform certification.** Its 87 upstream helper tests and 10 synthetic observation probes do not satisfy any Corbanu sprint's final-tree gate.

## Requirement ownership

A1's missing-work recommendations are explicit owners, not implied by a generic “security tests” task: secretless process/environment PF-27; global/reflected-output gates PF-28; migration PF-29; durable provenance PF-30; public-browser isolation/downloads PF-31; screened provider routing PF-32; SSRF/actual connection PF-33; sanitizer/quarantine PF-34; local/hosted classifiers PF-35/36; login boundary PF-37; financial executor PF-38; derived/disclosure controls PF-39; behavior monitoring PF-40; actual-state inspector/audit PF-41. PF-13 and PF-15–25 retain existing authority/UI ownership. PF-26 requalifies the whole final candidate.

<a id="pf-27"></a>

### PF-27 — Isolated credential broker and secretless launch

Sources: A1 secrets/process boundary; T 00:35:26, 00:45:38; OC-1/2/8.

Use a separately constrained broker plus authenticated run-scoped IPC. Replace PF-01-S05's raw child-environment injection with references-only agent launch. A proxy environment variable is not enforcement.

Current owners: [PF-27-S04](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md), [PF-27-S02](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s02-secretless-agent-launch.md).

<a id="pf-28"></a>

### PF-28 — Central output and reflected-secret protection

Sources: A1 centralized output protection; T 01:13:46; OC-1/2/3.

Scrub reflected provider/browser responses before they enter agent memory, all persistence/output sinks, short values and split encodings. Do not copy a bounded plaintext LRU into the agent or silently evict live secrets.

Current owners: [PF-28-S01](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-28-s01-central-secret-output-gate.md), [PF-28-S02](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-28-s02-reflected-secret-response-scrubbing.md).

<a id="pf-29"></a>

### PF-29 — Protected-mode inventory and human migration

Sources: A1 migration and operational readiness; A2 auth routes; OC-6.

Dry-run inventory → human preview → encrypted migration/recovery → re-audit. Old contaminated transcripts/memories require clean contexts or quarantine. No plaintext rollback backup or automatic credential rotation.

Current owners: [PF-29-S01](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-29-s01-protected-mode-inventory.md), [PF-29-S02](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-29-s02-human-secret-migration.md).

<a id="pf-30"></a>

### PF-30 — Durable provenance and post-taint authority

Sources: A1 durable provenance; T 00:42:33, 00:43:03, 00:48:08; OC-4/5/11.

Immutable ingress-assigned envelopes and sticky lineage across summaries, compaction, memory, imports, child messages and resume. Human exact approval authorizes one action; it does not erase taint.

Current owners: [PF-30-S01](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-30-s01-typed-source-envelope.md), [PF-30-S02](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-30-s02-persistent-taint-and-memory.md), [PF-30-S03](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-30-s03-post-taint-authority-checks.md).

<a id="pf-31"></a>

### PF-31 — Isolated retrieval and download promotion

Sources: A1 two-plane browser isolation; T 00:35:26; OC-8/9/10.

Pinned secretless public worker, constrained network/resources, no host fallback. Add explicit sealed download quarantine and exact human promotion; public workers never receive login cookies.

Current owners: [PF-31-S01](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-31-s01-pinned-retriever-isolation.md), [PF-31-S02](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-31-s02-bounded-fetch-no-fallback.md), [PF-31-S03](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-31-s03-download-quarantine-promotion.md).

<a id="pf-32"></a>

### PF-32 — Screened web facade and search providers

Sources: T 00:35:26, 01:06:42, 01:07:54; A2 web tooling; OC-2/4/9/10.

Preserve web.run shape while screening existing SearchClient, Exa, Brave and SearXNG. Remove recent conversation history from protected search, disable unscreened native search, bound same-role failover and spending.

Current owners: [PF-32-S01](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-32-s01-web-facade-and-registry.md), [PF-32-S02](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-32-s02-existing-search-and-native-bypass.md), [PF-32-S03](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-32-s03-exa-search-adapter.md), [PF-32-S04](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-32-s04-brave-search-adapter.md), [PF-32-S05](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-32-s05-searxng-search-adapter.md), [PF-32-S06](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-32-s06-privacy-routing-and-failover.md).

<a id="pf-33"></a>

### PF-33 — Destination validation and connection enforcement

Sources: A1 SSRF/rebinding and broker destinations; OC-2/8/9.

Validate URL/DNS/redirect and actual connected peer, then enforce no direct sockets/proxy escape. Explicit self-hosted search adapter exceptions do not widen the public-fetch lane.

Current owners: [PF-33-S01](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-33-s01-url-dns-and-redirect-policy.md), [PF-33-S02](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-33-s02-connection-pinning-and-bypass.md).

<a id="pf-34"></a>

### PF-34 — Sanitization quarantine and safe review

Sources: A1 sanitization/quarantine; T 00:47:20; OC-4/10/11.

Render-aware visible content, escaped model/terminal markers, encrypted raw artifact retention, bounded rescan, safe human review and failure/restart recovery. Sanitized does not mean trusted.

Current owners: [PF-34-S01](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-34-s01-render-aware-sanitization.md), [PF-34-S02](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-34-s02-quarantine-state-and-store.md), [PF-34-S03](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-34-s03-safe-quarantine-review.md).

<a id="pf-35"></a>

### PF-35 — Local classifier and blind qualification

Sources: T 00:35:26, 00:46:55; A1 untrusted-input pipeline.

Licensed, leakage-free corpus; reproducible CPU artifact; calibrated blind evaluation and fail-closed pre-model screening. Detector misses are contained by independent policy. OpenClaw wrapper heuristics are not a substitute classifier.

Current owners: [PF-35-S01](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-35-s01-classifier-corpus-and-evaluation.md), [PF-35-S02](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-35-s02-local-cpu-detector-artifact.md), [PF-35-S03](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-35-s03-calibration-and-ingress-gate.md).

<a id="pf-36"></a>

### PF-36 — Optional hosted detector and safe fallback

Sources: T 00:35:26 paid-service hypothesis; original PF-10.

Keep a provider-neutral, disabled-by-default optional lane; human data/cost consent and measured qualification precede activation. Qualified local fallback or pause, never unscreened output. No claim that a commercial vendor is already selected.

Current owners: [PF-36-S01](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-36-s01-hosted-detector-consent-contract.md), [PF-36-S02](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-36-s02-hosted-bakeoff-and-local-fallback.md).

<a id="pf-37"></a>

### PF-37 — Origin-bound browser login and human handoff

Sources: A1 first provider plus browser-login boundary; A2 credential handoffs; OC-1/2/8.

New exact-origin login adapter and separate credentialed session boundary, qualified against a fixture and one human-selected permitted origin with a non-production account. No model-controlled selectors, arbitrary eval, cookies/profile export or automated MFA/CAPTCHA bypass; human challenges stay outside recorded model input.

Current owners: [PF-37-S01](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-37-s01-origin-bound-browser-login.md), [PF-37-S02](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-37-s02-human-auth-handoff-lifecycle.md).

<a id="pf-38"></a>

### PF-38 — Typed financial execution and exact effects

Sources: T 00:35:26, 00:48:27; product Non-negotiable controls; OC-1/2 boundary pattern only.

Reuse PF-16–19 authority primitives; implement narrow existing-wallet/fake-venue adapters, complete-effect simulation/preview, separate sign/broadcast and idempotent receipts. OpenClaw is not evidence of trading/custody safety.

Current owners: [PF-38-S01](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-38-s01-typed-financial-executor.md), [PF-38-S02](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-38-s02-full-effect-preview-and-mandate.md), [PF-38-S03](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-38-s03-sign-broadcast-and-receipts.md).

<a id="pf-39"></a>

### PF-39 — Derived financial views and disclosure control

Sources: A1 protected data; T 01:06:04; product Non-negotiable controls.

Add purpose-limited derived financial views and reconstruction limits; cover provider payloads, tool arguments, search, clipboard, exports, social/email and child handoffs. Raw operational secrets remain non-disclosable.

Current owners: [PF-39-S01](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-39-s01-protected-financial-derived-views.md), [PF-39-S02](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-39-s02-outbound-disclosure-controls.md).

<a id="pf-40"></a>

### PF-40 — Agent Sweep and safe recovery

Sources: T 00:46:06; A1 deterministic containment.

Sanitized behavior events, deterministic anomaly rules, isolated optional advisory model, durable pause/revoke/kill and human recovery. Neither reviewer nor agent can lower a level or authorize actions.

Current owners: [PF-40-S01](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-40-s01-sweep-events-and-rules.md), [PF-40-S02](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-40-s02-isolated-sweep-reviewer.md), [PF-40-S03](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-40-s03-sweep-alerts-and-recovery.md).

<a id="pf-41"></a>

### PF-41 — Effective security inspector and audit

Sources: A1 inspector/audit; T 01:04:09, 01:13:46; OC-7/8.

Inspect effective runtime facts, degradation, broker/classifier/backend health, active grants/expiry, taint, recent denial and audit integrity. Support exports pass the same disclosure gate.

Current owners: [PF-41-S01](../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-41-s01-effective-security-inspector.md), [PF-41-S02](../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-41-s02-tamper-evident-security-audit.md).

## Additional work absent or insufficiently explicit in the archive

PF-27 process/OS enforcement replaces generic secret injection; PF-28-S02 addresses reflected credentials; PF-29 adds migration and contaminated resume handling; PF-30-S02/03 make memory taint and post-taint authority durable; PF-31-S03 adds sealed download promotion; PF-37 adds exact-origin credentialed login; PF-38 makes the existing wallet path and uncertain transaction recovery explicit; PF-39-S02 covers non-chat disclosure sinks; PF-41 adds actual-state inspection and tamper-evident safe export.

Credential and policy follow-ups extend accepted foundations without duplicating them. No cancelled firewall record is used as a completed dependency; the nine accepted security-foundation archives are valid dependencies for their original scope. Numeric order is a valid topological implementation order, not a time estimate. The October 8 deadline is retained; expanded effort and hardware/vendor/platform prerequisites must be assessed before readiness, not hidden by marking drafts complete.
