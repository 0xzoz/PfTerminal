# Proposed plans

Plans here are drafts with `status: draft`. They do not consume an active-plan
slot and do not authorize implementation.

| Proposal | Priority | Owner | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Arbitrary-model Autoreview](arbitrary-model-autoreview.md) | P1 | Alex Good | Turns explicit second-model review into one secret-scanned, isolated, exact-runtime workflow across configured Corbanu providers |
| [Named accounts (PF-84): flag removal](named-accounts-flag-removal.md) | P1 | Codex PF-84 lane owner (proposed); Travis accepts | The six flag-removal prerequisites carried from the provider-onboarding plan closed 2026-10-14; live checks need test accounts |
| [Prompt-injection firewall and brokered authority](prompt-injection-firewall.md) | P0 | Jim Ricketts | Historical input reconciled into the active P0 security plan on 2026-08-28; no separate implementation authority |

## September 9 transcript portfolio

September 11: accounting became active workstream 2 ([completed 2026-10-10](../completed/main-2026-10-10-portfolio-agent-cost-accounting.md)),
with S01 selected for kickoff. The other 15 portfolio initiatives remain draft.
On 2026-10-10 [provider onboarding](../completed/main-2026-10-14-unified-provider-auth.md) was
activated in the freed slot for PF-84 named accounts. [Current three-stream allocation](../main-workstreams-2026-09-11.md).

The [portfolio map](../portfolio-2026-09-09.md) covers Alex's product discussion
and adjacent/enabling ideas. After the [September 10 follow-up](../call-followup-2026-09-10.md),
the historical portfolio contains 16 initiatives and 52 sprints. The September
11 disposition above supersedes its earlier no-activation status.
The [September 10 scrum packet](../scrum-2026-09-10.md) records the receiving
`main` baseline and remaining activation decisions. No new active slot or worker
allocation is implied.

available.
