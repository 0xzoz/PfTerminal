# <Plan title>

Policy: repository-root `AGENTS.md`

Plan lifecycle: `docs/plans/index.md`

## Activation record

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | draft |
| Active-plan slot | pending |
| Product authority |  |
| Authoritative decision |  |
| Target release |  |
| Deadline |  |

## User pain

<What is painful or impossible for the user today?>

## Product intent and ideal flow

<Describe the best end-to-end experience in plain English: entry, success,
failure, recovery, resume, and return use.>

## Product linkage

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Exact product-spec heading |  |
| Requirement excerpt |  |
| Product outcome advanced |  |
| North-star criterion advanced |  |

## Scope

### In

- `<in-scope item>`

### Out

- `<out-of-scope item>`

## Invariants

- `<boundary that must remain true in every implementation stage>`

## Ownership and implementation worktrees

| Owner | Worktree | Branch | Base commit | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |

## Useful code references

For parallel initiatives, allocate distinct named owners/worktrees/branches in the table
above and define scope plus receiving integration gates in each sprint. Follow
`docs/sprints/index.md`; an unallocated draft does not reserve a worker slot.

| Path or symbol | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |

## Sprint execution map

Every implementation sprint must link exactly one feature in this plan. Link
current sprint records under `docs/sprints/current/`; replace completed links
with release evidence after the sprint is archived.

| Feature ID | Current sprint records | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | pending |

## Acceptance flows

| Flow | Starting state | User action | Expected visible result | Pass criterion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary success |  |  |  |  |
| Failure/cancel |  |  |  |  |
| Recovery/resume |  |  |  |  |

## Implementation sequence

Keep each implementation stage reviewable under the repository change-size
guidance. A stage may land behind a non-user-accessible boundary, but the
initiative remains unfinished until every acceptance and release gate passes.

1. `<first implementation stage>`
2. `<second implementation stage>`
3. `<third implementation stage>`

## Automated evidence

Code-blind functional gate: `<frozen design, independent executor/run identities,
isolation receipts, exact-package results and independent review; or accepted N/A>`.
Follow repository-root `AGENTS.md` and `qa/code-blind-functional/README.md`.
Reserve one design pass and one evidence check within the track's existing
review allowance; allocate independent isolated execution separately. Do not
expose source or prior findings to designer/executor; name the manager responsible
for packet provisioning, isolation validation and failure replay.

Run fix and formatting tools before the final affected tests.

| Check | Final-tree command | Result | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Focused |  | pending |  |
| Integration |  | pending |  |
| Snapshot, if applicable |  | pending |  |
| Adversarial or security, if applicable |  | pending |  |

## True-TUI evidence

Launch through the repository TUI workflow. Send prompt text and Enter as
separate key actions. Corbanu `exec` is not acceptable proof.

| Flow | Candidate binary | Test repo/worktree | Keys/actions | Visible checkpoints | Result | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary |  |  |  |  | pending |  |
| Failure/cancel |  |  |  |  | pending |  |
| Recovery/resume |  |  |  |  | pending |  |

## Live-repository applicability

| Repository | Applicable to this initiative? | Resolved checkout/test worktree | Base commit | Reason or result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TensorCash | yes/no |  |  |  |
| Isometric Game | yes/no |  |  |  |

## Human acceptance

| Tester | Date | Candidate version/commit | Flow | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  | pending |  |

## Documentation

| Finished-feature doc | Product-spec citation present | Verified candidate |

## Dependencies, decisions, and blockers

## Completion

- [ ] Product linkage, scope, invariants, and worktrees are current.
- [ ] Every implementation unit is represented by a valid single-feature sprint.
- [ ] Required final-tree automated evidence passes.
- [ ] Code-blind cases independently executed under enforced isolation; schema-2 handoff check and independent evidence review pass (or accepted non-user-facing N/A); review ledger linked.
- [ ] Required true-TUI and live-repository evidence passes.
- [ ] Human acceptance passes.
- [ ] Finished documentation matches the candidate.
- [ ] Release and benchmark records are linked.
- [ ] No hard release gate remains pending.
