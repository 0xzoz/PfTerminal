# 2. Accounting — unified agent cost and usage

## Closing note (2026-10-10)

**Completed by Travis's decision on 2026-10-10**, freeing active slot 2. All five PF-60 sprints are accepted and
archived; S04, the last, was accepted on 2026-10-10 with known limits after its independent code-blind acceptance
(PR #397). The same day Travis lifted S05's waiver (a) (OpenAI API-key estimates now recompute exactly) and accepted
the remaining gaps on condition that each is carried into a future sprint.

- **Exception, as for P0 security:** closed without a release. Collection and `/cost` are on main, developer-only
  (debug builds with `developer-accounting`); shipping them to users is not authorised. The `main-2026-10-10` prefix
  names the tree, not a release.
- **Carried forward:** every accepted gap, the open release linkage and S05's waiver (b) (enforced isolation gate)
  are in the [accounting follow-ups plan](../active/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting-followups.md), sprints PF-60-S06 to PF-60-S10, each with acceptance criteria
  and an issue. It needs Travis's activation and a free slot; nothing there is authorised yet.
- **Open accounting issues not assigned to a follow-up sprint** are listed in that plan's "Dependencies, decisions,
  and blockers" for Travis to place.

## Current state (2026-10-10, at close)

- **All accounting work is on main.** PR #138 merged the integration branch on 2026-10-04 (merge `3ecc3c4066`);
  `integrate/management-workstreams-20260911` has nothing left that main lacks.
- **Collection is developer-only.** Travis answered `accounting-collection-activation-20260916` with developer-only
  activation: collection and `/cost` exist only in debug builds with the `developer-accounting` Cargo feature (core and
  tui). Optimized builds with it do not compile and `build_codex_package.py` refuses to package them. Shipping `/cost`
  to users is not authorised.
- **S01, S02, S03:** done and archived. Travis accepted **S03** on 2026-10-09 after the independent code-blind
  acceptance and three re-runs (PRs #292, #311, #315, #328). Follow-ups, not blockers: #287 (clock-behind WARN
  wording), #325, and the 09-20..10-02 body review's findings, owned by S05; review Minors 6, 7, 9 and Nits 11-14
  have no sprint yet. Carried limits are in the [archived record](../../sprints/archive/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s03-inspectable-run-and-campaign-totals.md#remaining).
  **S05:** done and archived. Travis accepted it on 2026-10-09 with two waivers (AC10's OpenAI API-key
  micro-dollar estimate until #361 is fixed, PR #369; AC11's OS-enforced isolated execution gate) after the
  independent code-blind acceptance (#355) and its real-credential re-run (#362). Billing basis is declared per route
  and credential (option B). Known gaps (ChatGPT login, image generation, realtime, Kimi Open Platform, BigModel,
  mutation tests) and follow-ups (#352, #359, #361/#369, #365, #366, #370) are in the
  [archived record](../../sprints/archive/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s05-collection-correctness-and-billing-basis.md).
  Waiver (a) was lifted on 2026-10-10 (addendum in S05's Closure).
  **S04:** done and archived. Travis accepted it on 2026-10-10 with known limits, after the independent code-blind
  acceptance (#397). Both S05 hand-overs are closed (#383 `/side` and consolidation recorded; #385 no price metadata
  on unpriced requests), and every cost flow passed on one recorded binary
  ([qualification](../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/qualification.md)) and again independently.
  Known limits and their follow-up sprints are in the
  [archived record](../../sprints/archive/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s04-cost-accounting-acceptance-and-handoff.md).
- **Worktrees:** none active. The S04 lane, `worktrees/pf60-s04-20261010` (branch `work/pf60-s04-20261010`), was
  released at S04's archive; it and the S05 lane stay in front matter as the last recorded lanes. The S05 lane,
  `worktrees/pf60-s05-20261009` (branch `work/pf60-s05-20261009`), was released at S05's archive. The S03 lane,
  `worktrees/pf60-s03-20261008` (branch `work/pf60-s03-20261008`), was released at S03's archive. The September lane
  checkouts (acct-inspect, acct-chat, bootstrap-acct-ws) were removed after #138; the remaining `accounting-*`
  worktrees and `workstream/accounting-*` branches hold only commits already on main.
- **Open issues:** #127 (tiered Grok pricing, mitigation PR #135), #129 (OpenRouter cap reconciliation).

Everything below the next heading through "Activation record" is the September 12–15 log, kept as history.

## September history

September13 02:08UTC: compact import independently reviewed clean and received
at81d0f90e7; combined595shared/100Core/20focused/6external, format/Clippy/check
pass. [Receiving proof](../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02/compact-late-import-receiving.md)
preserves original failures and metadata correction. Manager hold cleared; next
is [original-contract native golden tests](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/original-contract-native-golden-allocation.md),
exact two paths, target800/150 STOP900/200, existing Mendel in the new checkout
above. No new user decision; S02 active, S03 dependent, collection OFF.

Historical September13 allocation: manager accepts the [complete compact-only import
allocation](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/compact-late-import-allocation.md),
exact eight state/test/receipt paths in its recorded historical checkout, target2000/650,
STOP2200/750 for one atomic operation plus native/public/process/failure proof.
Combined Core correction100/575 tests, Clippy and check all pass; historical
failures remain. One new material review plus necessary correction, default OFF.
No new source acquisition, user import UI or complete S02 acceptance is implied.

September13 00:14UTC: exact933/279 candidate b320ef722, review01 clean0.94,
received2cb69e429 and combined with PF13 at eb5855959. Parent100 focused tests
pass18.334s; shared575/Clippy/check are running on the frozen combined Rust tree.
Mendel prepares only the smallest compact late-import allocation. S02 stays
active, S03 dependent; collection OFF and historical failures are not waived.

23:13UTC: ten-file Core candidate returned835/249,100focused and575shared tests
plus normal check pass. Original eight errors cleared;24 emitted Clippy errors
at16 pre-existing native-test helper sites remain. Manager inspected and added
only those assertions to the [same correction](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/core-policy-repair-allocation.md),
same ten paths/ceiling, runtime frozen. Mendel continuation precedes first
material review; no new product question or historical failure waiver.

22:44 manager continuation: eight-file policy repair reviewed clean and received
at37f23b991; parent575/575 zero skips and normal six-library check pass. Core's
eight existing-policy errors remain. [Current ten-file Core correction](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/core-policy-repair-allocation.md)
is allocated to Mendel in the fresh Core-policy checkout above, target950/300,
STOP1100/375, one new material review plus necessary correction. Preserve all
prior failures and default-OFF boundaries. Manager owns receiving proof; no user
question. Earlier correction assignments below are history, not concurrent work.

21:48 manager continuation: first policy repair193/101 passes575full/105focused
and normal check. Eight newly exposed lint errors in the external normal-library
accounting_store test are now explicitly added as the eighth path in the same
[correction allocation](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/policy-lint-repair-allocation.md).
Use existing public SQLite shim and Result propagation; no new API/test weakening.
Same450/225 ceiling and unspent first review; implementation resumes, no human hold.

20:57UTC manager handoff: reviewed Anthropic code is integrated; receiving71
focused plus840shared tests and normal-library check pass. Existing-policy lint
fails in accounting fixtures/schema and preexisting API telemetry. The current
Mendel assignment is [exact seven-file corrective allocation](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/policy-lint-repair-allocation.md)
in the new policy-repair checkout above, target300/150 STOP450/225. No test
weakening or baseline waiver; prior full-Core failures remain. Late compact
import follows after this correction; S02 remains active, S03 draft, collection
OFF. Earlier native caller allocations below are historical, not new work.

18:44 manager reallocation: review02 confirmed automatic redirects bypassing
the approved accounting endpoint. Preserving existing client policy needs four
exact login/HTTP-builder files, added to the existing24-file worker allocation;
combined27-path3900total/1450non-test ceiling and remaining review03 are recorded
in the [allocation](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/anthropic-dispatch-allocation.md).
No new product contract or live authority; OFF behavior and all historical
tests/reviews remain. Full-Core133 baseline-matched failures are not a pass.

17:22UTC: first native-caller review found one P2: accounting's provider copy on
role reload discards explicit child retry/timeout overrides. Parent verified the
literal merge path and authorized the first same20-path correction after the
current baseline diagnostic; preserve explicit supported role settings and fail
unapproved endpoint changes before send. Existing size/review allowance suffices;
no new auth/product decision, source acceptance or baseline waiver.

Latest17:12UTC: native caller returned frozen at87a9a81ad,3017total/904non-test
across20 worker paths; combined dependency delta3019/906 fits the allocation.
Focused native/API208/state287 pass. Full Core3401passed/132failed/19skipped/
1leaky remains non-clean, with no proven baseline attribution. First independent
code review and one matched clean-launch baseline diagnostic are running; source
stays frozen. Manager owns classification/integration, not a new human blocker.
No acceptance, live collection or S03 activation is claimed.

Latest16:08UTC: manager accepts [native Anthropic sampling allocation](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/anthropic-dispatch-allocation.md),20 worker files plus3 serialized manager dependency files. Direct-first explicit native opt-in, defaultOFF; actual per-send admission/retry identity/raw usage/original bundled-price/reopen proof. Target3500/1350, STOP3750/1450; one new code review plus up to2 scoped corrections, earlier review history retained. Security owner granted a narrow30-minute lockfile lease; no PF27 implementation or unsafe approval. Exact worker dispatch/launch is recorded separately, not inferred from this allocation. S02 continues; S03 remains draft.

Latest15:45UTC: normal-library store accepted at6b2dbcab5 and integrated into
receiving9518184ac after clean independent review03. All367 combined state/TaskNode
tests pass (one leaky, zero skipped,16.922s); worker287-test evidence and earlier
failed reviews remain in the [receipt](../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02/production-store-increment.md).
Exact17-path candidate2057total/829non-test fits the specifically granted2150/1000
correction allowance. Mendel prepares actual provider/runtime caller allocation;
this preparation is manager-owned, not a new human blocker. Collection stays OFF;
full S02/S03 remain gated. Earlier store allocation text below is historical.
Older accepted native bridge and original allocation evidence follows.

Current September12: native bridge accepted, exact six-file candidate `0eb98e8d3` integrated at `8725e1ff755a5fa974058f465f3553b3f9b884eb`; worker clean fast-forward verified.

Parent governance3/115/126exit0. [Native receipt](../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02/native-ownership-increment.md) preserves950total/227non-test and original worker failures/results; parent evidence above is separately attributed.

Accepted C2 history: six-file `b7a3466de` integrated at `d5608c58d91a75396fea78b447477c44091d4625`. First independent Astra High `c2-atomic-review.json` exited0 clean.

[C2 receipt](../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02/atomic-retention-increment.md) and original failures/review usage stay frozen. Its1519total/190non-test one-candidate disposition is not800compliance; C1's1121-line exception and335passed/2leaky history remain recorded.

The [opt-in normal-library store](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/production-store-allocation.md) is accepted history, not the next unit; calling it next was stale. Its original terms follow for the record. Manager approved target1900total/950conservative non-test including moves/receipt, estimate1515/795. Above800 is justified by one coherent versioned-installation, normal-library/native lifecycle and atomic original-price binding unit with failure/concurrency proof, not inherited exceptions. One NEW code review plus necessary correction and one allocation review if needed; prior usage unchanged. Report actual overage before expansion. This pass changes allocation documents only; parent inspects/reviews/integrates before source dispatch and checks disjoint shared state ownership. Default no-install/collection OFF, S03 draft and90..365-day late import/fullcaller/real-price provenance gaps remain explicit.

Policy: repository-root `AGENTS.md`. Lifecycle: [plans](../index.md).
Portfolio: [source coverage, sequencing and human capacity](../portfolio-2026-09-09.md).
This is active workstream 2. S01 is accepted/archived; S02's first isolated
native-state journal increment is reviewed and integrated locally. Production wiring, live collection
and runtime human acceptance remain gated. The first checkout is the receiving
manager; the second is the reused independent accounting worker.
Dispatch follows the verified main merge; an allocation is not a running-agent claim.

Historical receiving result: reviewed S01 candidate `1c5978690` is integrated
locally at `0415a00dc3`; 48 fixture tests pass on the combined tree. The
[manager handoff](../workstream-manager-handoff-2026-09-11.md#accounting-decision)
records Travis's explicit approval of the v1 defaults in this task. Do not
re-ask that decision. The reviewed [S02 handoff](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/s02-allocation.md)
resolves exact first-increment boundaries; S01 is now archived and S02 is selected.
Native candidate `3f39d7a65` passed independent Astra High review and was received
at `c33d47f6c`; all 202 state tests passed there. The manager owns the next
same-sprint allocation; this is not full S02 or user-interface readiness.
Quotation e8ffdad4e is also reviewed/integrated at 486d2fb94, with all214 state
tests passing. Immutable storage d898fbac0 is now reviewed/integrated at56295f668;
all220 state tests pass on that combined tree. Contributions/deletion b08fff66d
are reviewed and integrated at3898eaa65; all226 state tests pass there. Exact compact
values c8d46d709 are now reviewed/integrated;237 state tests pass on that tree.
That worker increment closed. Conservative daily expiry was approved; do not re-ask it.
Latest-quote8b6d629b6 passed independent review and combined staging tests at
04ba6b8b7 (242state/80TaskNode). [Staging evidence](../../../qa/initiative-control/native-staging-2026-09-12.md)
distinguishes that historical staging result from receiving/publication. A/B/C1/C2
subsequently integrated; current evidence and next native scope are recorded above.

## Activation record

- Status: completed 2026-10-10 (was active, slot 2/3, from September 11); no release (see Closing note).
- Authority: Travis's September 11 workstream selection and Astra High kickoff request.
- Codex owns contract preparation; Travis approved the v1 defaults in this task on September 11, including vocabulary, retention/replay, exact USD estimates and unknown handling.
- S01 handoff and archive are complete. S02 starts with test-only native-state persistence, not billing, a collector, production migration or live prices.

## User pain

Parent/child agents and different providers make total spend hard to explain; missing prices must not look like free work.

## Product intent and ideal flow

Inspect one run and its descendants, distinguish measured tokens, estimated cost, billed cost and Corbanu API balance, then reopen the same totals after restart.
Entry is the first sprint's approved contract; success, failure and return-use are defined below.

## Product linkage

- Exact heading: **Product measurement** in [the product spec](../../corbanu-product-spec.md).
- Requirement excerpt: “No commercial performance numbers have been supplied.”
- Feature: **PF-60**; outcome: Inspect one run and its descendants, distinguish measured tokens, estimated cost, billed cost and Corbanu API balance, then reopen the same totals after restart.
- Source: transcript discussion at 01:58:15–02:02:41; see portfolio for attribution caveats.
- This citation supplies product context, not authorization for additional scope. Any new schema/public contract is reviewed and approved in S01 before implementation readiness.

## Scope

- In: Accounting contract and golden fixtures; Idempotent usage persistence and replay; Inspectable run and campaign totals; Collection correctness and declared billing basis; Cost-accounting acceptance and handoff.
- Out: Changing prices, rebilling historical customers, collecting prompts, restoring legacy Plan allowances, or silently converting allowance to cash.

## Invariants

- No credential, proprietary strategy, customer log or financial record is disclosed by default; only approved redacted/public/synthetic inputs leave the host.
- A model finding or a passing test is not authority to publish, spend, trade, change permissions, merge or release.
- Unknowns remain unknown; negative findings and no-go decisions count as useful research, not fabricated completion.
- Extend existing product/native contracts; do not create parallel usage, orchestration, auth or release authorities.

## Ownership and implementation worktrees

| Accountable role | Worktree | Branch | Base | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex accounting lane (PF-60-S03 catch-up, tests, demos; released 2026-10-09 at S03 archive) | `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/pf60-s03-20261008` | `work/pf60-s03-20261008` | `63ea3d0cbd0ccb54d352b25a12c3e07f9f934bff` | S03 ledger, regression tests, unavailable-backend next steps, demo videos; small PRs to main |
| Codex accounting lane (PF-60-S05 collection correctness; released 2026-10-09 at S05 archive) | `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/pf60-s05-20261009` | `work/pf60-s05-20261009` | `7ac8fcb6cb5eb568a62161ec190d5f04ba1fee2a` | S05 write scope (declared basis, ledger format, best effort, guardian attribution); slice PRs to main |
| Codex accounting lane (PF-60-S04 acceptance and handoff; released 2026-10-10 at S04 archive) | `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/pf60-s04-20261010` | `work/pf60-s04-20261010` | `5e2298a12900b07c1e55805dba8d79854eb803cd` | S04 write scope (side/consolidation attribution, basis-only request detail, qualification, demos); slice PRs to main |
| Codex management / Travis acceptance | none | main | n/a | Shared plan; S03 accepted 2026-10-09 |

The September lanes (direct Chat, Responses WebSocket, contract goldens, inspection) are consumed history; their
checkouts were removed after PR #138.

S02 retains its reservation; Travis approved conservative daily expiry in this
task. The [compact-value allocation](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/compact-values-allocation.md)
is accepted and frozen, not a new worker assignment. The
[retention design handoff](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/retention-design-handoff.md)
records the approved policy. The [latest-quote allocation](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/latest-quote-allocation.md)
owns the historical reviewed three-file prerequisite, now frozen. The
[read-only allocation](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/retention-plan-next.md)
and [C2 allocation](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/retention-coupled-next.md)
are accepted history, not work to repeat. The [native bridge](../../research/agent-cost-accounting/native-ownership-allocation.md)
is now accepted and joins complete C2 operations under `cfg(test)`. The next store
unit promotes a typed normal-library facade with optional versioned installation,
not a production collector. Separate `_accounting_migrations` sequence0001 is
manager-approved; ordinary migrations must not create/adopt that ledger. Failed,
partial/checksum/newer schema is not silently repaired; installation/activation
crash must recover without a fake Active checkpoint. Default startup installs
nothing; installed-store deletion remains atomic even when collection is disabled.
Public deletion signatures/counts/missing-row semantics and normal no-schema
behavior stay unchanged; no blanket new activation/failure checks. Separate
logs/memory/goals stores remain outside main-state transaction atomicity.
Custom range/interval filtering is recorded in S03 draft, not implemented here.
The migration/17-file store allocation above is accepted history. Travis opened the accounting resumption gate on September 14; current dispatch
is the accepted direct Chat Completions sampling allocation above (`acct-chat-design-01`, verified September 15, digest `0736d392`). Both the HTTP unit and
the Responses WS sampling/fallback unit are consumed history. Manifests/locks stay manager-owned.
The worker fast-forwards to
the reviewed receiving allocation before dispatch; its historical branch name
does not change sprint ownership. Manager owns shared plans/integration.

## Useful code references

| Existing path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-rs/state/migrations/0041_provider_request_cache_usage.sql` | Existing boundary to inspect/reuse; not a claim that this feature already exists |
| `codex-rs/app-server/src/request_processors/token_usage_replay.rs` | Existing boundary to inspect/reuse; not a claim that this feature already exists |
| `codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/usage.rs` | Existing boundary to inspect/reuse; not a claim that this feature already exists |
| `codex-rs/tui/src/token_usage.rs` | Existing boundary to inspect/reuse; not a claim that this feature already exists |

Research/artifact paths in the sprint table are planned files, not existing implementations. External harness/research locations must be identified by the owner; absence blocks that sprint rather than licensing a guessed rebuild.

## Native lifecycle and upstream-touch record

- Observed planning checkout: `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/CorbanuTerminal`, branch `recovery/corbanu-drive-2026-09-02`, HEAD `6f8f4ce46446e951437e1ce7e7c4a526e5b9e546`.
- Historical source only. This amendment receives main `295aed26e53b17f919f7199ae1c9748b1b1250ba`; the [current handoff](../main-workstreams-2026-09-11.md) supersedes the earlier scrum allocation. Preserve main's Corbanu API balance semantics, not legacy Plan entitlements.
- Canonical upstream: `https://github.com/openai/codex.git`; locally verified common ancestor `413492cd6c3a4d4f8dff6f406247ccda5a9d88aa`. Source seams, cached upstream identity and unintegrated newer tip are recorded in the reviewed S02 handoff; no upstream upgrade qualified.
- Inspect the existing references above; keep product-owned implementation behind thin native adapters, preserving event/replay/schema contracts. Exact files, compatibility tests and retain/adapt/remove dispositions are filled at S01 handoff before code readiness.
- Follow [upstream integration](../upstream-integration.md). Shared migrations, module registration, lockfiles and config schemas require serial ownership.

## Sprint execution map

All records belong to the single feature **PF-60**. Dependencies are hard prerequisites, not suggestions. S01 contract/fixture review and defaults approval are recorded; runtime evidence remains pending.

## Acceptance flows

| Flow | Starting state / action | Expected result and pass criterion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Success | Approved inputs; execute bounded sprint sequence | A root with two children has exactly three independently attributable request records, one nonduplicated aggregate and explicit unknown-cost markers. |
| Failure/cancel | Missing input, rejected gate or interrupted work | A duplicate event, interrupted request, missing price or denied provider produces no invented zero and no double charge. |
| Recovery/resume | Reopen from a recorded checkpoint | Kill after a recorded request, restart and reopen the run; totals and attribution agree without a manual database edit. |

## Implementation sequence

1. **Accounting contract and golden fixtures:** Every fixture has raw inputs, expected totals and provenance; no unknown value is rendered as zero.
2. **Idempotent usage persistence and replay:** Replay each fixture twice and after process restart; persisted and reconstructed totals equal the approved fixture exactly.
3. **Inspectable run and campaign totals:** The user can explain each displayed total using constituent requests without inspecting storage.
4. **Collection correctness and declared billing basis:** Subscription work is never counted as spent, each provider's billing basis is declared rather than inferred, and accounting failures never discard a paid response.
5. **Cost-accounting acceptance and handoff:** All cost flows pass on one recorded binary; unknown/estimated values remain visibly distinct.

## Independent functional execution — September 12

The next applicable user-facing handoff follows the mandatory
[isolated execution gate](../../../qa/code-blind-functional/isolated-execution.md).
The named integrator owns packet/isolation provisioning and separate executor
and reviewer assignments; implementation owners do not execute acceptance cases.
Record increment-specific internal-only N/A with later functional gate, not a
plan-wide exemption. Missing isolation is manager work, not unanswered approval.
Existing evidence stays historical; dependencies, feature flags and live authority
are unchanged. See the linked rollout table for this lane's next acceptance.

## Automated evidence

- Every sprint: `python3 docs/plans/check.py; python3 docs/sprints/check.py` from repository root; `git diff --check`.
- Focused commands and artifact checks are explicit in each sprint. A newly specified selector must be registered, shown to run nonzero tests and resolved before readiness; an empty test filter is not evidence.
- Evidence includes input/candidate digests, command, timestamps, exit status, expected versus actual result and limitations. Checklists alone do not prove behavior.
- All evidence fields remain pending until the actual final tree or artifact is checked; this planning pass does not execute the future sprint tests.

## True-TUI evidence

Required for applicable runtime/rehearsal journeys: use the final built candidate in an isolated actual PTY with `RUST_LOG=trace` and private log directory. Send literal input and Enter separately. Exercise the success, failure/cancel and recovery/resume rows above; capture reachable controls, exact model/provider, binary hash, base SHA, keys, checkpoints and cleanup. A tester may use only public user controls; fixture setup is a separate operator role. Shell repair of auth or hidden state invalidates user recovery proof. Corbanu `exec`, a model review and snapshots alone do not qualify these flows. Result: **pass**, 2026-10-10, on main
`1e9cd464b9` ([qualification](../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/qualification.md)) and independently on
`b1e20a8ec6` ([independent acceptance](../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s04/independent-acceptance-20261010/README.md)):
success, cancel, missing price, retry, reopen, kill -9 and restart, history and date bounds with real keys through tmux.

## Live-repository applicability

| Repository | Applicability for this scope | Checkout/base | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TensorCash | Required where the selected runtime/QA journey affects live repository work | Not reachable (`agtico/tensorcash` does not resolve for this account) | NOT VERIFIABLE; carried to PF-60-S09 |
| Isometric Game | Required where the selected runtime/QA journey affects live repository work | n/a | Not applicable: accounting doesn't change repository work (S04 qualification) |

Release-level live-repository gates remain intact regardless of this plan's bounded applicability.

## Human acceptance

Travis approved S01's v1 defaults on September 11 in this task; the linked manager
handoff records the exact decision and candidate. Native/runtime human testing
was accepted sprint by sprint: S03 and S05 on 2026-10-09, S04 on 2026-10-10 (Travis, in chat with the
coordinator), each after an independent code-blind acceptance. Agent review never substitutes for that acceptance.

## Documentation

Research outputs stay under the declared research/QA paths. Finished-feature docs change only after qualification and name the verified candidate and product-spec citation. Unimplemented possibilities remain proposals.

## Dependencies, decisions, and blockers

- Approved defaults stand; manager accepted separate `_accounting_migrations` sequence0001, typed facade and default no-install/collection OFF. Verify receiving collisions; ordinary migrator cannot adopt the separate ledger.
- S01 archived; A/B/C1/C2/native accepted. The exact17-path store awaits parent document acceptance/integration and dispatch, not a new product decision. No live caller is allocated.
- Actual dispatch/presence/original-price authority, full native goldens and90..365-day compact-only late import remain S02 obligations, explicitly unqualified and not waived. This store supplies neither permanent deleted-ID fencing nor cross-database erasure. S03 is in progress (see Current state).
- Before each next sprint: predecessor evidence accepted/archived, its handoff resolves concrete inputs and any newly discovered decisions; otherwise stop.
- Cross-plan IDs in the table must exist and be completed in the receiving ledger. A draft dependency does not activate either plan.
- Before dispatch: agreed budget, named human acceptance owner, exact scope and privacy permissions. No capacity or deadline is assumed from hardware ownership alone.

## Release linkage

None. Closed without a release by Travis's decision (2026-10-10), as P0 security was: collection is developer-only and
shipping `/cost` is not authorised. Release linkage, and the live-repository and isolation gates a release would need,
are carried to the [follow-up plan](../active/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting-followups.md).

## Completion

- [x] All sprint outputs are accepted and linked; no expected evidence is invented (S01–S05 archived, 2026-10-10).
- [x] Scope, inputs, dependencies, exact allocation and authority are current (no lane active at close).
- [x] Automated/artifact checks and applicable actual-key tests pass (S04 qualification and independent acceptance).
- [x] Named human accepts: Travis accepted S04 on 2026-10-10 and closed the plan the same day.
- [x] Remaining ideas are separately gated: the [follow-up plan](../active/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting-followups.md) is a draft; no hard gate is silently waived.
- Not done here, carried to the follow-up plan: release linkage and finished user docs (collection is developer-only);
  the enforced isolation gate (S05 waiver (b)); the NOT VERIFIABLE flows; the accepted gaps listed in S04's Closure.
