# P0 `/security` levels

Policy: repository-root `AGENTS.md`. Plan lifecycle: `docs/plans/index.md`.
Everything written before 2026-10-06 (allocations, review ledgers, round notes,
expanded contracts) is in the [history file](../history/p0-security-levels-2026-10-06.md).
Deferred features are in the [P1 security hardening plan](../active/p1-security-hardening.md).

## Closing note (2026-10-08)

Travis closed this plan on 2026-10-08 and gave its slot to the [P1 security hardening plan](../active/p1-security-hardening.md).

- **Delivered:** the work of all 20 core sprints plus the broker-lane PF-27-S05 is on main behind default-off flags
  (`security_levels`, `secret_output_gate`, `url_destination_policy`, `protected_mode_preflight`,
  `isolated_credential_broker`, `secretless_agent_launch`); each sprint record holds its gate evidence. Twenty of the
  21 records are archived. PF-28-S02, PF-29-S01/S02,
  PF-33-S02 and PF-41-S01 were archived at close; their recorded open items moved to P1.
- **Carried forward, not done:** [PF-13-S07](../../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-13-s07-integrated-credential-boundary-qualification.md)
  moved to P1 still `ready`: its gate passed on 2026-10-07, but its final archive waits on the Aggressive milestone.
  None of the three milestones (Aggressive ships, Moderate ships, flag removal) has run. No isolated code-blind VM
  run, human sign-off, Permissive-compatibility rerun or versioned release covers this work. All of these are open
  items in the P1 plan's [carried-forward table](../active/p1-security-hardening.md#carried-forward-from-p0).
  This is therefore a decision-closed plan, not a released one. The `main-2026-10-08` filename prefix names the
  tree that holds the work, not a release.
- **Task Node:** P0SEC-TN-01..09 were all Rewarded (27.5 PFT, 2026-10-08). The
  [task map](../../../qa/initiative-control/p0-security-levels/tasknode-task-map.md) lists tasks, PRs and evidence.
- **Demo reel:** [narrated P0 security reel](https://corbanu-p0-security-reel.cloudflare-share.workers.dev/)
  (11:51; [chapters and sources](../../../qa/demos/index/P0-security-reel.md)).
- **Still hosted here:** drafts PF-76-S01 and PF-77-S01 (not security; see below) need a new home plan.

## Activation record

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | **Completed** (closed by Travis, 2026-10-08); slot 1 passed to P1 security hardening |
| Authoritative decision | “Accountable sequencing,” item 1: `/security` is P0 and begins immediately |
| Binding scope decisions | Travis, 2026-10-06: PF-83 closes; flagged picker ships early; 20-sprint core; 3 lanes; tiered gate |
| Delivery owner / integration owner | Jim Ricketts / Codex /root security coordinator |
| Deadline | 2026-10-09 (Travis, 2026-10-06) |

## User pain

Corbanu has approvals, sandboxing, a vault, wallet scopes and tool permissions,
but they are spread across the product. A user cannot answer “How locked down
is my agent right now?”, and turning protection on must not silently change an
existing installation.

## Product intent and ideal flow

The user types `/security` and picks one of three levels. The current level is
obvious, a change shows its differences before confirmation, `Esc` changes
nothing, and only a human can change or downgrade the level.

| Level | User promise | How it ships |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Permissive** | Exactly today's behaviour. No policy is added, removed or rewritten. | Default; the flag-off path |
| **Aggressive** | Sensitive access denied by default; narrow, expiring human grants. | First built only from existing controls (PF-24-S03), then deepened by PF-23-S02 and PF-25 |
| **Moderate** | Strong protection around untrusted content, secrets and protected actions while normal work continues. | Added to the picker only as its protections land (broker and untrusted-content lanes, PF-23-S01) |

## Product linkage

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Product-spec heading | **P0 `/security` levels** — “Existing approval, sandbox, vault, wallet, tool, network, and agent policies are unchanged.” |
| Credential heading | **Required trust boundaries** — “Credentials are referenced by label and resolved only inside a trusted execution boundary.” |
| Permission confirmation | **Permission selection confirmation — TO BUILD** — “A submitted selection is not a confirmed change.” (PF-83, closed) |

## Scope

In: the `/security` picker behind the `security_levels` feature flag; Aggressive
from existing controls; the broker, output gate, migration and destination
controls (PF-27, PF-28, PF-29, PF-33); durable provenance (PF-30); Moderate and
Aggressive enforcement (PF-23); confirm/downgrade, grants and kill switch TUI
(PF-24, PF-25); the inspector (PF-41-S01); final credential qualification (PF-13-S07).

Out: everything moved to the [P1 hardening plan](../active/p1-security-hardening.md)
(PF-26 final program qualification, PF-27-S06 Windows broker and launch, PF-31, PF-32, PF-34, PF-35, PF-36, PF-37,
PF-38, PF-39, PF-40, PF-41-S02); replacing `/permissions`; changing Permissive;
letting a model choose or downgrade a level; conformance claims to external standards.

## Invariants

- Permissive is current behaviour; flag off is byte-for-byte today's product.
- Only a human changes the level; no agent tool, prompt, config or project file can.
- Moderate and Aggressive are deterministic; model judgment can warn, never grant.
- Unknown or corrupt stored state fails visibly; it never becomes Permissive.
- Downgrades are explicit and invalidate incompatible pending authority.
- Child agents inherit the same or a stricter level.
- Protected levels keep managed secrets out of model, env, argv, logs and artifacts.
- The UI never shows a protection as active when it is not; unbuilt controls read “not available”.

## Ownership and implementation worktrees

Each lane worker creates its own worktree under `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/`
off `origin/main` and records it in front matter before its sprint becomes
`ready`. The coordinates above are the existing draft-record and paused PF-27-S04
/ PF-30-S01 worktrees. The integration owner serializes shared Cargo/Bazel/lock,
protocol and schema edits.

## Useful code references

| Path | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-rs/tui/src/security/`, `tui/src/bottom_pane/security_view.rs` | Existing `/security` view (PF-24-S01) |
| `codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/permission_popups.rs`, `tui/src/app/permission_confirmation.rs` | Existing permission picker and PF-83 confirmation path |
| `codex-rs/features/src/lib.rs` | Feature flags; add `security_levels` |
| `codex-rs/core/src/security/` | Effective policy, transition, taint, protected surface |
| `codex-rs/secret-broker-service/`, `codex-rs/network-proxy/` | Broker (PF-27) and egress/destination policy (PF-33) |
| `codex-rs/execpolicy/` | Forbidden-command rules used by Aggressive vault denial |

## Sprint execution map

At close: 20 of the 21 records archived; PF-13-S07 carried to P1. Core: the 19 named in decision 3 plus the picker. A lane is a
worker slot; a sprint still waits for its dependencies in any lane.

| Lane | Sprints in order |
| --- | --- |
| broker | PF-27-S04 (completed 2026-10-06, [archived](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md)) → PF-27-S02 (done, PR #191, [archived](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s02-secretless-agent-launch.md)) → PF-27-S05 (done, PRs #229/#237, [archived](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s05-model-client-auth-broker.md)) → PF-28-S01 (done, PR #208, [archived](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-28-s01-central-secret-output-gate.md)) → [PF-28-S02](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-28-s02-reflected-secret-response-scrubbing.md) (PR #216, archived at close); Windows follow-up [PF-27-S06](../../sprints/archive/p1-security-hardening/pf-27-s06-windows-broker-and-launch.md) moved to the P1 hardening plan |

| convergence | [PF-41-S01](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-41-s01-effective-security-inspector.md) (after PF-23-S03, PF-24-S02, PF-29-S02), then [PF-13-S07](../../sprints/current/p1-security-hardening/pf-13-s07-integrated-credential-boundary-qualification.md) (carried to P1 at close) |

Cross-lane waits: PF-24-S02 needs PF-23-S03 and PF-29-S02; PF-25 needs PF-23-S02/S03;
PF-23-S01 needs PF-30-S03. The [sprint index](../../sprints/current/p0-security-levels/index.md)
lists exact dependencies. PF-41-S01 no longer waits on PF-32-S06, PF-37-S02 or
PF-40-S03; it shows those controls as “not available”.

### TUI lane bugs from PF-83

Handed to the TUI lane on 2026-10-06 by decision 1; carried to the P1 plan at close. Each is a bounded fix against
**Permission selection confirmation — TO BUILD** and runs under the per-sprint gate.

| Bug | Found in | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typed text in an open approval prompt can approve it with “don't ask again” (`/permissions` hit the `p` shortcut) | Campaign 35, F05 | open; fix before Aggressive ships |
| “Enable full access?” defaults to Cancel and gives no message when cancelled | Campaign 35, F03 | open |
| A declined request renders both “You canceled…” and “Ran … (no output)” | Campaign 35, F05; PF83-DEF-015 | source fix pf83-unran-18 is on main; verify on the next candidate |
| `zai-anthropic` route: `glm-5.2` has no catalogued max-output limit, so every turn fails | Campaign 35, F11 | open (`core/src/client.rs` catalog) |

### Hosted non-security records

[PF-76-S01](../../sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-76-s01-provider-profile-persistence.md)
(provider profile persistence) and [PF-77-S01](../../sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-77-s01-tasknode-reliability.md)
(Task Node reliability) are drafts hosted here for history, outside the security
core and lanes. They stay `draft` under this closed plan until rehomed. Completed hosted records PF-77-S02, PF-78-S01/S02 and PF-82-S01 are archived.

## Acceptance flows

| Flow | Pass criterion |
| --- | --- |
| Flag off | Product behaves and renders exactly as before; `/security` unchanged |
| Open and cancel | `Esc` closes the picker; no config, session, child or audit change |
| Select Aggressive | Differences shown first; after confirmation every listed control is enforced on the next turn, for children too, and survives restart |
| Return to Permissive | Prior settings restored exactly; incompatible pending approvals invalidated |
| Agent attempts a change | No agent-reachable path changes the level |
| Select Moderate (later) | Offered only when its protections are complete; unsupported routes fail visibly |
| Hostile content (Moderate) | No protected value or unauthorized action reaches model output or execution |
| Grants, revocation, kill switch | Narrow expiring grants; revocation and kill switch hold across restart |

## Implementation sequence

1. Picker (PF-24-S03) and the PF-83 TUI bugs → milestone **Aggressive ships**.
2. Broker and untrusted-content lanes in parallel; PF-33 and PF-29 take the first free lane.
3. PF-23-S01..S03, then PF-24-S02 and PF-25 → milestone **Moderate ships**.
4. PF-41-S01 and PF-13-S07 → milestone **flag removal**.

### Delivery gate

**Per sprint** (merge behind the flag when all pass):

- focused tests via `just test` on the final tree, after `just fmt` and `just fix -p <crate>`;
- a tmux functional test with real keys, product on GLM 5.2 (`-m glm-5.2 -c model_provider="zai"`);
- one independent review by an Opus 5.5 High subagent;
- short videos showing every core feature of the sprint end to end, recorded with
  `qa/demos/README.md` once it lands; until then an asciinema recording of the tmux
  session, keeping the `.cast` under `qa/security-levels/sprints/<sprint>/`.

**Milestones** (Aggressive ships, Moderate ships, flag removal): the full isolated
code-blind VM run under the root `AGENTS.md` rules, plus named human sign-off.
Up to three security sprints may be reserved at once, one per lane, with
disjoint `write_scope` (enforced by `docs/sprints/check.py`).

## Automated evidence

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Governance | `python3 docs/plans/check.py && python3 docs/sprints/check.py` | per PR |
| Per sprint | `cd codex-rs && just test -p <affected-crate>` after `just fmt` / `just fix` | per sprint record |
| Permissive compatibility | PF-21 harness against the frozen baseline `3c1b2f6cbe11657ff4e3b72b11db029c9e7a92eb` | pending, each milestone |

## True-TUI evidence

Per sprint: tmux run on GLM 5.2 plus `.cast` videos, recorded in the sprint record.
Per milestone: isolated code-blind execution with schema-2 receipts and a separate
evidence check ([workflow](../../../qa/code-blind-functional/README.md)).

## Live-repository applicability

| Repository | Applicable | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TensorCash | yes | Permissive compatibility and Moderate protected-action workflow |
| Isometric Game | yes | Aggressive, inheritance, downgrade and recovery workflow |

## Human acceptance

| Milestone | Tester | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aggressive ships | named by release owner | pending |
| Moderate ships | named by release owner | pending |
| Flag removal | named by release owner | pending |

## Documentation

`docs/features/security.md`, `docs/slash_commands.md` and the vault/auth pages
describe only behaviour verified at a milestone, citing **P0 `/security` levels**.

## Dependencies, decisions, and blockers

| Item | State |
| --- | --- |
| PF-83 open items (designer packet, review count 7/5, process isolation) | Recorded in the archived [PF-83-S01](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-83-s01-permission-confirmation.md); not blocking the core |
| Aggressive vault denial from existing controls | PF-24-S03 must prove it; if impossible, stop and escalate |
| Aggressive sandbox design (A: `corbanu-aggressive` permission profile; B: literal `SandboxPolicy` table; C: `on-request` approvals) | Decided: A, the `corbanu-aggressive` profile as merged in #186 (Travis, 2026-10-07) |
| Global reservation cap | 3 security lanes + 1 accounting + 1 Task Node = 5 (`docs/sprints/index.md`); confirmed by Travis 2026-10-06 |
| October 9 deadline | Plan closed 2026-10-08 by decision; milestones carried to P1 without a date |

## Release linkage

No `qa/release/<version>/` record: no release contains this work yet (0.1.48 predates it). Milestone runs,
human sign-off and release linkage moved to the P1 plan.

## Completion

- [x] PF-83-S01 closed with per-case results; defects handed to the TUI lane (2026-10-06).
- [x] Deferred scope moved to the P1 hardening plan with dependencies intact (2026-10-06).
- [x] All core sprints merged behind flags; 20 of 21 records archived (2026-10-08).
- [x] Plan closed by Travis's decision (2026-10-08); slot passed to P1.
- Not done here, moved to P1: Aggressive ships; Moderate ships; flag removal with Permissive compatibility proven
  and no critical finding open; PF-13-S07 archive.
