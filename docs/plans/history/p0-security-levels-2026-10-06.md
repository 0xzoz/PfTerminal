## Current permission-confirmation allocation — September 14

Travis's explicit "yes, scope is expanded" authorizes the app-server/TUI
confirmation repair with next-turn command permission semantics. This narrow
PF-83 amendment is distinct from the rejected global-quiescence/PF-22-S03
proposal and does not change the protected `/security` contracts below.
The security owner explicitly handed back PF-27-S04's reservation to the repair
coordinator; PF27 returns to draft with its paused work/evidence intact. This
supersedes historical PF27 execution-status prose, not its remaining scope.
There remain three active plans and only one executable security sprint.

Product citation: **Permission selection confirmation — TO BUILD**:
"A submitted selection is not a confirmed change." Existing live capability
citation: **Live MVP versus the P0 security controls**, "approvals, and general
workspace sandboxing." Current user approval permits only confirmation API
semantics and associated UI/compatibility tests; the no-Permissive-policy-change
and no-replacement-of-`/permissions` exclusions continue to hold.

| Feature | Contract | Sprint | Owner / receiving gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PF-83 | Request-correlated permission application outcome and truthful next-turn UI | [PF-83-S01](../../sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-83-s01-permission-confirmation.md) | Astra High permission-confirmation worker; this repair coordinator receives and verifies, then coordinates any integration with the existing Fable writer |

PF83 owns the exact worktree/branch/base above and only the literal sprint scope.
The previous PF27 owner remains paused, no broker work is dispatched, and
accounting/Task Node scopes do not overlap the selected app-server/TUI files.
No canonical integration worktree, running app/profile/shortcut, service or
credential is modified by the allocation. Raw estimate: one bounded engineering
increment plus review and isolated qualification; reserve at least35% for
integration/testing, no calendar completion guarantee. Local pinned Rust1.95
builds use the repair's private cache, not historical RTX-only round-five tooling.

### PF-83 outcome and evidence contract

Success/no-op returns a request-specific applied outcome; invalid updates return
their correlated failure. Unknown effects on timeout/disconnect stay uncertain
without blind retry. Register correlation before submission and bind it to
connection/thread/listener generation; clean pending state on terminal paths.
TUI selection/cache must not claim backend confirmation before that outcome.
Active-turn command authority stays unchanged; the next turn picks up the
confirmed selection in either direction. Already-pending command approvals,
background process lifetime, MCP policy refresh, persistence and provider wire
are unchanged. Old servers with no applied acknowledgement remain visibly
unconfirmed; old clients' acceptance behavior is preserved through a narrow
opt-in confirmation path where required. No new dependency or Core authorization
change is allocated.

Upstream touch: canonical `https://github.com/openai/codex` ancestor
`413492cd6c3a4d4f8dff6f406247ccda5a9d88aa`, verified by canonical commit API
and local ancestry; fork base `005cc644f59b1e762e5497b329e106c67925d4ed`.
This is not an upstream update: no merge/rebase candidate or upgrade pass.
App-server pending outcome module and thin native processor/listener adapters
own correlation, TUI adapters own presentation, generated v2 fixtures own wire
parity. Detailed source proof and receipt live in
[the repair evidence](../../../qa/reliability/live-permission-transition-20260913/manager-checkpoint.md).

Required acceptance: success/no-op/failure, rapid stale responses, disconnect and
restart, old/new server combinations, both permission directions, next-turn
continuation and pending approvals. Freeze originals F01-F11; attach the user's
next-turn scope as an explicit amendment, not rewritten cases. Exact-package
independent enforced code-blind execution and independent evidence check remain
mandatory. Both TensorCash and Isometric Game disposable workflows apply;
resolve bases before execution. Human acceptance is pending. API documentation
must describe actual semantics; finished user docs wait for qualified evidence.
No release/install is authorized; benchmark/release assessment remains a later
candidate gate. Plan/sprint checks and affected app-server, protocol, TUI plus
unchanged relevant Core regressions must pass; commands are in the sprint.

Policy: repository-root `AGENTS.md`

Plan lifecycle: `docs/plans/index.md`

## Activation record

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | **Active** |
| Active-plan slot | **1 of 3**; September 11 sequential-workstream allocation |
| Product authority | Defined once in the product specification |
| Authoritative decision | “Accountable sequencing,” item 1: `/security` is P0 and begins immediately |
| Delivery owner | Jim Ricketts |
| Deadline | **2026-10-08** |

## Reconciled planning decision — 2026-08-28

Travis Good requested the full security program, selectively reusing the cancelled
firewall decomposition and using the working-session overview/transcript and
OpenClaw implementation as primary grounding. This **planning update**, not a
product-code or release change, merges those contracts into this one active plan.

[Source reconciliation and all 72 archive dispositions](../security-source-reconciliation.md)
records the source hashes, transcript timestamps, pinned OpenClaw code, differences
from that reference and new owners. The earlier proposed firewall plan remains
historical input, not competing implementation authority.

The [OpenClaw source review](../openclaw-source-review-2026-08-28.md) pins the
2026-08-28 download at `13adff02ca3897768d80d2bca18f5acf08c55d91` and maps
implementations, callers, defaults and tests to OC-1–11. It is targeted reference
research, not OpenClaw-wide or Corbanu release qualification. Reuse persistent
memory provenance as well as turn taint; explicitly test open-channel revocation,
complete reflected-secret removal, missing-lineage handling, proxy/DNS bypasses
and migration ownership. Upstream's trusted-host defaults are not Moderate or
Aggressive guarantees.

Local source-reference input: `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/.codex-work/references/openclaw-13adff02`.
It is a clean detached checkout of `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git` at
the exact review pin above, with Git hooks disabled; all 42 files in the recorded
source manifest matched their SHA-256 values on 2026-08-30. Agents should use it
for local source reads without fetching, switching revisions, installing or
running OpenClaw. A pin change requires an explicit review update first.

For each adaptation, record the pinned upstream function/test, Corbanu owner and
small Codex integration hook, license notice, deliberate differences and final-tree
regression evidence. Keep the source checkout/reference outside the Corbanu runtime
dependency graph. PF-26 must track unexecuted reference cases separately from
passing candidate evidence; no source citation alone closes an acceptance item.

- **Permissive retains compatibility.** No mandatory broker, environment purge,
  ingestion classifier or migration is silently added to its shipping path.
  Existing stricter low-level restrictions remain intact.
- **Every level above Permissive requires the broker.** Moderate and Aggressive
  use separately constrained credential/financial execution, secretless agent
  launch and deterministic ingress/disclosure policy. Unsupported adapters or
  isolation fail visibly; they never fall back to raw credentials.
- **All source requirements have owners.** Earlier 68/73-record snapshots are
  historical. Sprint 13, PF-34-S04, PF-27-S03, round-two integration, and the
  completed PF-13-S06/PF-41-S03 round-three foundations preserve 24 completed
  archives and leave **52 current units**. All 72
  cancelled firewall records and seven unrelated Autoreview drafts are unchanged.
- **No evidence is retroactively accepted.** Upstream's PF-15–22 and PF-13-S01
  completions remain accepted for their original scope. The stronger review
  requirements have separate follow-ups; PF-13-S05 is completed and archived and
  PF-13-S07 owns final composed credential qualification.
- The existing October 8 deadline is unchanged, but this larger program has not
  been effort-estimated or scheduled. The owner must assess capacity and surface
  any conflict; no scope or release gate is silently waived.

## Accepted architecture refinement — 2026-08-28

Travis Good authorized the assessed recommendations after the Opus 5 / Extra
review. The [architecture appendix](../security-architecture-refinements-2026-08-28.md)
records accepted/rejected claims, platform/state and upstream-seam contracts,
action/profile usability, durable events and required regression detail.

Five draft preparation/foundation sprints make independent work explicit:
PF-27-S03 platform containment, PF-31-S04 retriever artifacts/engine fixtures,
PF-33-S03 pure destination policy, PF-34-S04 segment/verdict fixtures and
PF-41-S03 durable audit/recovery. PF-35 corpus/CPU work now follows the completed
segment contract, while real screening still depends on sanitizer and policy
integration. Browser login gains its missing screening dependency.

The plan opts into the [bounded parallel process](../../sprints/index.md#bounded-parallel-implementation)
with the exact integration owner recorded in front matter. No extra execution owner or worktree has
been allocated and no sprint is activated by this amendment. Keep PF-13-S05 and
PF-26 final qualification, full Moderate/Aggressive guarantees, independent
Permissive evidence and the existing deadline pending measured capacity review.

## Execution capacity and handoff decision — 2026-08-29

Product authority confirmed maximal LLM execution capacity, supplied platform
access for Mac, Windows and Linux, and confirmed that LLM reviewers are always
available. Sprint reviews use Computer Use to operate the logged-in Claude UI
with **Claude Opus 5.0** visibly selected and effort visibly set to **Max**. Each
review still requires immutable packet/model/effort/result evidence, verified
finding disposition and reruns. Reviewer availability does not replace the named
human final-acceptance gate.

The initial coordination packet at
`qa/security-levels/planning/parallel-handoffs-2026-08-29/README.md` historically
divided the first round into foundation/platform, browser/retrieval and
ingress/classifier legs. It is evidence, not current dispatch authority. The
round-two packet at
`qa/security-levels/planning/parallel-handoffs-2026-08-30-round-2/README.md`
owns new dispatches after PF-27-S03 integration.
PF-13-S05, PF-31-S04, PF-33-S03, and PF-27-S03 are completed and archived.
PF-27-S03 occupied the foundation/platform slot at dispatch base
`1907d99aed9714f05a5f54fca1703658017d616c`; one sprint may run at a time in
each lane. A handoff document is coordination, not execution authority: before a
draft becomes `ready`, this plan and its sprint record must name the exact owner,
CorbanuDrive worktree and branch, 40-character post-handoff `main` base, parallel
lane, literal disjoint `write_scope` and `integration_gate`, and both governance
checkers must pass.

PF-13-S05 transferred from its historical Travis worktree to the
`foundation-platform` worktree at `6a35712cd5731b191d875e8c6468f1abe23eb66e`
on 2026-08-29. Historical candidate, executable and platform evidence remains
bound to the commits and paths recorded in that evidence; the transfer does not
relabel it. The transferred sprint owns only the explicitly amended Core repair
files and final qualification artifacts recorded in its sprint record. Jim
Ricketts remains the integration owner.

Until midpoint sprint estimates exist, reserve **35% of total delivery capacity**
for integration, rebases, reviewer-finding remediation, reruns and evidence.
After estimates exist, each sprint reserves `max(0.5 day, 0.20 * midpoint)` plus
0.5 day for each applicable serialized shared surface, consumed cross-lane
contract, and all-OS/true-TUI/live-repository evidence requirement. Add one day
per cross-lane convergence gate and two days for final PF-26 convergence;
reforecast after every gate. Reviewer availability itself is not charged, but
finding remediation is. No calendar feasibility claim is made until raw sprint
estimates, retriever pins, corpus/licensing and the weakest-supported CPU exist.

The browser/retrieval worktree was reallocated on 2026-08-30 at
`1a5562738cb3d53bd4d0b6668761cfe76bd4b93e` for bounded remediation of the
post-archive tmux/Corbanu Terminal/Claude Opus 5 Max findings. PF-31-S04 and
PF-33-S03 rotate through that one lane sequentially; no protected route is
activated by this follow-up.
[PF-31-S04 remediation](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-31-s04-retriever-artifact-preparation.md)
completed at `c2168575695dfb2ad015bf45ef24d9e4b173b571`.
[PF-33-S03 remediation](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-33-s03-destination-policy-contract.md)
then completed sequentially at `80a2469e401066ebaf04d95ba603ab68cb341854`;
the browser/retrieval lane is returned after re-archive.

Credentials and machine login details remain only in the local gitignored
`AgentCredentials.md` chain and must never enter a branch, evidence bundle,
review packet or transcript. Supplied access proves reachability, not platform
containment or release qualification. Tooling, builds, caches, temporary files
and review exports for these lanes remain on CorbanuDrive.

## Upstream reconciliation — 2026-08-28

This review branch incorporates upstream `1bdc515bff48a4d9048dae7d06c6214e884265bc`.
Its runtime code, completed sprint records and qualification artifacts are retained;
this merge adds no runtime implementation or new release qualification.
[Reconciliation evidence](../security-upstream-reconciliation-2026-08-28.md)
records the two parent revisions, preservation checks and planning validation.

| Accepted foundation | New requirement owner | Integration dependency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PF-13-S01 opaque capability/store | PF-13-S06 usage reservations and trusted metering | PF-13-S03 before live transport |
| PF-19-S01 generation/revocation types | PF-19-S02 dispatch fence and emergency restriction | PF-41-S03 / PF-22-S02, then transports and financial recovery |
| PF-20-S01 versioned config persistence | PF-20-S02 protected authoritative state | After PF-27-S03; before runtime and migration |
| PF-21-S01 frozen independent baseline | PF-21-S02 expanded surfaces and upstream drift | Before PF-22-S02 and final PF-26 |
| PF-22-S01 policy and child inheritance | PF-22-S02 protected runtime and upstream seams | After new state/fence/event/compatibility contracts |

PF-15–18 need no duplicate implementation sprint. Preserve all nine archives and
their original evidence byte-for-byte. New cases cannot be checked off from those
historical passes. The historical PF-22-S01 workspace run was **not green**:
15,788 ran, 15,617 passed, 169 failed, two timed out and 28 were skipped.
The owning repair work and final-candidate qualification remain required.

The allocated Mac worktree/base follow upstream's record; the independent
pre-feature Permissive baseline remains `3c1b2f6cbe11657ff4e3b72b11db029c9e7a92eb`.
Neither updating allocation nor merging upstream rewrites that oracle.

## User pain

### Sprint 13 implementation integration — 2026-08-28

The published `feat/pf-13-s02-scoped-vault-resolver` branch through
`c25e2825a2fe3fe63c8e1d58cc1e3aa82b0d1d04` is integrated into this plan.
PF-13-S02–S05 and the early PF-26-S01 harness are completed and archived;
PF-13-S05 closed after clean integrated Core, Windows component, and independent
review evidence. PF-13-S07 now owns final composed qualification after
PF-13-S06 and downstream isolation/output/migration/connection controls.

The branch's earlier PF-27 shared-contract work remains completed as PF-27-S01.
The refactored isolated broker is PF-27-S04. Earlier overlapping PF-28–30 planning
records are superseded by the canonical PF-27–41 decomposition; their code and QA
artifacts remain integrated inputs, not duplicate completed dependencies.

Canonical record links: [PF-13-S02](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-13-s02-scoped-vault-resolver.md),

[PF-27-S04](../../sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-27-s04-isolated-credential-broker.md).

Corbanu already has approvals, sandboxing, a vault, scoped wallet actions, and
tool permissions. Those controls are spread across the product. A user cannot
answer one simple question: “How locked down is my agent right now?”

Security settings should be understandable without learning internal policy
types. They should also be optional: introducing the feature must not silently
change the behavior of an existing Corbanu installation.

## Product intent and ideal flow

The user types `/security` and sees one focused tab with three choices:

| Level | User promise |
| --- | --- |
| **Permissive** | Corbanu behaves exactly as it does today. Existing policies are not changed. |
| **Moderate** | Corbanu adds strong protection around untrusted content, secrets, sensitive data, credentials, and protected actions while preserving normal agent workflows. |
| **Aggressive** | Sensitive access is denied by default. The user opens narrow, expiring permissions explicitly, and every sign or broadcast requires exact human approval. |

The current level is obvious. Moving to another level shows the policy
difference before confirmation. `Esc` cancels without changing anything.

A confirmed change takes effect immediately for the current session and child
agents, persists across restart, invalidates incompatible pending approvals,
and creates a secret-free audit event. Only the human can change or downgrade
the level.

## Product linkage

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Exact product-spec heading | **P0 `/security` levels** |
| Plan requirement excerpt | “Existing approval, sandbox, vault, wallet, tool, network, and agent policies are unchanged.” |
| Credential trust-boundary heading | **Required trust boundaries** |
| Credential requirement excerpt | “Credentials are referenced by label and resolved only inside a trusted execution boundary.” |
| Product outcome advanced | One understandable control for agent security posture |
| North-star criterion advanced | External content cannot silently gain sensitive access or change security policy |

## Scope

### In

- Add `/security` as a first-class slash command and TUI tab.
- Define a standards-derived authorization contract for protected actions,
  grants, delegation, revocation, and adversarial coverage.
- Define one persisted `SecurityLevel` value: Permissive, Moderate, or
  Aggressive.
- Default existing and upgraded installations to Permissive.
- Prove Permissive uses the current policy resolution paths without adding,
  removing, or rewriting a policy.
- Make Moderate enforce the product-spec controls for untrusted content,
  model-visible secrets and protected data, trusted credential resolution,
  protected-action previews and approval binding, redacted audit events,
  revocation, and kill switch.
- Make Aggressive include Moderate and then default sensitive tools, account
  access, credential use, protected-data disclosure, financial actions,
  arbitrary egress, and clipboard/export paths to denied.
- In Aggressive, allow only narrow human grants with visible scope and expiry;
  require exact human approval for every sign or broadcast.
- Make active and newly spawned agents inherit the selected level and prevent
  agents, tools, project content, hooks, plugins, connectors, and MCP servers
  from weakening it.
- Show the current level and a concise protection summary in the tab and
  session status.
- Require explicit human confirmation for a downgrade; cancel or restart must
  not apply an unconfirmed change.
- Add compatibility, policy, adversarial, snapshot, and true-TUI evidence.
- Implement the complete PF-27–41 contracts below: process/environment containment,
  reflected-output gates, migration, durable provenance, isolated retrieval,
  screened search adapters, SSRF controls, sanitization/quarantine, local and
  optional hosted detection, browser login, financial execution/derived views,
  outbound disclosure, Agent Sweep, and runtime inspection/audit.

### Out

- Implementing external protocol servers, new trading venues, or unrelated
  integrations. Security-specific existing-search/Exa/Brave/SearXNG adapters,
  one reviewed login origin plus fixtures and the optional detector interface are in scope;
  this is not authorization for paid accounts, live trades or commercial contracts.
- Claiming conformance to AP2, OAuth, OpenID, or SPIFFE; this plan adopts
  relevant control semantics inside Corbanu.
- Adding unrelated product capabilities or downstream integrations.
- Changing the existing behavior of Permissive.
- Replacing the existing `/permissions` surface; `/security` composes the
  relevant existing controls into a user-facing posture.
- Allowing a model or model-based reviewer to choose, change, or downgrade the
  security level.
- Publishing a finished-feature page before the accepted candidate passes the
  required evidence.

## Invariants

- **Permissive is current behavior.** Its policy snapshot and representative
  workflows must match the pre-feature baseline.
- **Only a human changes the level.** There is no agent tool, prompt command,
  config instruction, or project-file mechanism that can do so.
- **Moderate and Aggressive are deterministic.** Model judgment can warn but
  cannot grant authority.
- **Unknown state fails visibly.** A corrupt or unknown stored level cannot
  silently become Permissive.
- **Downgrades are explicit.** They show what protection is being removed and
  invalidate incompatible pending authority.
- **Inheritance never weakens.** Child agents receive the same or a stricter
  effective level.
- **Protected modes keep managed secrets outside agent-readable paths.**
  Raw operational credentials and custody material never enter model, generic
  tools, shell environment/argv, logs, transcripts, summaries or artifacts.
  Permissive retains its baseline and makes no added secretless guarantee.
- **Independent defenses compose.** Isolation, tool policy, broker authority,
  egress checks, screening and output gates are separate controls; no classifier
  score or source wrapper grants authority.
- **Taint is durable.** Compaction, memory, a new turn or another agent cannot
  promote untrusted material. Exact human action approval does not erase taint.
- **Failures are observable.** Missing backend, broker, required local classifier,
  safe migration or audit prerequisites block affected protected work; no silent
  native-search/host-browser/raw-auth fallback.
- **Bound the claim.** The protected boundary covers managed credentials and
  classified/configured protected resources. Inventory/redaction heuristics do
  not guarantee discovery of every unknown secret in arbitrary user text, nor
  defend against a fully compromised trusted host. Unknown routes/data deny or
  quarantine; known historical exposure requires clean-context recovery.
- **Aggressive grants are narrow and expire.**
- **Kill switch and revocation override pending work and survive restart.**

## Standards-derived control profile

This profile borrows mature control shapes without turning `/security` into a
standards-integration project. The implementation remains local and
provider-independent. A standard is a design source only where the plan names
the exact behavior adopted.

| Source | Behavior adopted by `/security` | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [OpenID AuthZEN Authorization API 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/authorization-api-1_0-final.html) | Separate the policy enforcement point from the deterministic policy decision point; represent each check as subject, resource, action, context, and an allow/deny decision | Adopt the decision shape; do not require a networked AuthZEN service or claim conformance |
| [OAuth Rich Authorization Requests, RFC 9396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9396.html) and [OAuth Token Exchange, RFC 8693](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693.html) | Give every temporary grant explicit action, resource, destination, limits, actor chain, and expiry; delegation must narrow authority and preserve the acting agent | Adopt authorization and delegation semantics; do not build an OAuth server |
| [OpenID Shared Signals and CAEP](https://openid.net/three-shared-signals-final-specifications-approved/) | Model downgrade, revocation, kill switch, and risk changes as durable events that invalidate cached decisions, grants, and pending approvals | Adopt invalidation semantics locally; cross-system signal exchange is out of scope |
| [Agent Payments Protocol 0.2](https://ap2-protocol.org/ap2/specification/) | Keep approval on a non-agentic trusted surface; bind human approval to the exact canonical action preview; return a secret-free receipt; reject mutation, replay, or mismatch | Adopt the mandate pattern for protected actions; payment and commerce support is out of scope |
| [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/) | Make every applicable agentic risk category traceable to at least one prevention control and one adversarial test | Use as the release threat-coverage baseline, not as a certification claim |

The release evidence must include a versioned crosswalk from each adopted
behavior to its code boundary, automated test, adversarial case, and true-TUI
flow. Standards drift after the 2026-08-23 review date requires an explicit plan
update; it cannot silently change Permissive or an accepted security level.

The PF-34-S04 creation coordinate remains the immutable base recorded above.
After allocation, the lane rebased onto `main` at
`1a5562738cb3d53bd4d0b6668761cfe76bd4b93e` to include the corrected TMUX and
provider behavior before independent review. The final lane-owned remediation
candidate is `a75efecc0a37d5544e123ad19d57867cac360a68`. On 2026-08-30 the user
transferred Jim Ricketts's unavailable G1/G2 integration responsibility to the
Codex ingress/classifier lane. The reviewed commits remain immutable. The lane
combined `main` first at `1907d99aed9714f05a5f54fca1703658017d616c`,
registered the crate at `de99c7af1774cb964f9fcf0cbbfaf2a07c1a059d`,
removed the unused dependency alias at
`279ce48a9e8d3b28ab518ff184aae770d7462d2f`, and reconciled the subsequently
advanced `main` at `3232f5e65bae60bc86122a5495ebb4c280f7c8fb` in merge
`158b9b0ebe4b06a81c98be6a58a0d1c7919a0d08` before final qualification.

Literal PF-34-S04 write scope: `codex-rs/content-security/`,
`codex-rs/Cargo.toml`, `codex-rs/Cargo.lock`, root `BUILD.bazel`, root
`MODULE.bazel.lock`, `.github/workflows/security-ingress-contract.yml`,
`qa/security-levels/ingress-contract/`, `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-34-S04/`,
the current and archive PF-34-S04 sprint-record paths, the current security sprint
index, the global sprint index, `mkdocs.yml`, and this active-plan allocation.
Its `parallel_lane` is `ingress-classifier`. Shared registration is now serialized
inside this one lane; no concurrent sprint owns any listed path.

## Round-two parallel allocation — 2026-08-30

Round two is completed and archived. PF-19-S02 merged first, PF-20-S02 second,
and PF-21-S02 third; the integration owner then updated all compatibility CLI
callers, rebuilt the merged Corbanu binary, reran the policy/config/Core suites,
passed the 36/36 compatibility matrix, and completed a true-TMUX smoke. Protected
activation remains unavailable.

That next frontier was subsequently allocated as round three below. PF-41-S03
and PF-13-S06 completed their disjoint foundation work. Product authority also
resolved PF-35-S01's preparation decisions, but the real corpus campaign,
private blind-custodian aggregate, signed production artifact and N100
measurements remain evidence gates rather than inferred passes. The 35%
integration allowance was recalculated for round three.

After PF-34-S04 was archived, the user's 2026-08-30 integration instruction kept
the Codex ingress/classifier lane as integration owner and assigned PF-27-S03's
serialized G1 registration. That lane merged current `main`, audited the literal
scope, and registered the standalone contract crate; the foundation/platform
lane remained the candidate owner. Integration authority was not returned to
Jim Ricketts by the merge.

Literal PF-27-S03 write scope: `codex-rs/secret-broker/`,
`codex-rs/Cargo.toml`, `codex-rs/Cargo.lock`, root `BUILD.bazel`, root
`MODULE.bazel.lock`, `.github/workflows/security-platform-contract.yml`, the
three `scripts/security_platform_probe` command/implementation/test paths,
`qa/security-levels/platform/`, `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S03/`, the
current and archive PF-27-S03 sprint-record paths, both sprint indexes,
`mkdocs.yml`, and this active plan. Its `parallel_lane` is
`foundation-platform`. Shared registration is serialized at G1; no concurrent
sprint owns any listed path.

Implementation does not occur in the documentation checkout. Update this plan
before changing the implementation worktree, base, owner, or scope.

Parallel preparation lanes and integration gates are in the architecture appendix.
Before a second worker starts, assign distinct named execution owners and exact
worktrees/branches/base commits, fill each sprint's literal write_scope and
integration_gate, and record a dated capacity estimate. The existing shared
coordinates are not permission for concurrent workers in the same checkout.

## Round-three parallel allocation — 2026-08-30

Product authority resolved PF-35-S01's corpus, custody, hardware, model/runtime,
signing and distribution decisions and asked the integration owner to run the
next three dependency-complete lanes through merge and push. The immutable
dispatch base is `9d08b15fa94676c1383ee1605b77e7cc7218dcc4`.

| Lane | Sprint | Owner | Worktree | Branch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Classifier corpus | PF-35-S01 | Raman | `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/p0-security-classifier-corpus` | `feat/p0-security-classifier-corpus` |
| Credential reservations | PF-13-S06 | Pauli | `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/p0-security-credential-reservations` | `feat/p0-security-credential-reservations` |
| Durable events | PF-41-S03 | Huygens | `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/p0-security-durable-events` | `feat/p0-security-durable-events` |

The scopes are disjoint. PF-35 owns only `content-security` evaluation,
classifier manifests/tooling and its evidence; PF-13 owns the credential-usage
contract in `security-policy` and the existing Core capability seam; PF-41 owns
the new `security-audit` crate and its evidence. The integration owner alone
edits workspace/build registrations, shared navigation, this plan,
`humanTest.html` and `securityProgress.html`, merges each handback, and runs the
combined-tree suites and TMUX evidence.

Raw midpoint estimates are five days for PF-35-S01, three for PF-13-S06 and four
for PF-41-S03. Their formula reserves are 2.5, 1.6 and 1.8 days respectively,
including consumed contracts, serialized shared surfaces and required hardware
or fault-injection evidence. Add one day for each merge convergence gate and
reforecast after every handback. This retains at least the provisional 35%
integration posture; it does not claim calendar completion.

The checked handoff packet is
[`parallel-handoffs-2026-08-30-round-3`](../../../qa/security-levels/planning/parallel-handoffs-2026-08-30-round-3/README.md).
All three lanes require a real TMUX/Corbanu smoke and a read-only Claude Opus 5
Max review despite having no feature-level TUI contract. Those smokes are
supporting evidence and do not replace PF-26 true-TUI or human acceptance.

Round-three integration completed the PF-13-S06 credential reservation contract
and PF-41-S03 durable security-event foundation, including remediation from
independent Opus reviews, combined-tree reruns, shared export/workspace/build
registration and archival. PF-35-S01 delivered a deterministic, fail-closed
manifest/evaluator foundation and recurring CI coverage, but remains
`in_progress`: no private blind result, production signature, complete synthetic
corpus campaign or weakest-supported N100 performance result is claimed.

PF-22-S02 protected runtime integration is completed and archived after clean
combined-tree gates. PF-27-S04 isolated credential broker is ready for its
serialized integration. The released slot was allocated to PF-30-S01 from
post-archive base `b457249aa29c912cb2d5404f0939e8b2386f4e5e`, but product
authority returned that sprint to draft on 2026-09-02 after the drive failure;
no surviving implementation commit or handoff artifact exists. PF-35-S01's
external qualification remains independent. PF-35-S02 stays gated until S01 is
honestly completed and archived.

## Round-four rolling allocation — 2026-08-31

The user directed the integration owner to treat PF-35's externally operated
dataset/qualification campaign as independent of day-to-day engineering
capacity while preserving its honest `in_progress` evidence state. The formal
three-sprint limit remains. PF-35-S01 and PF-27-S04 occupy two recorded slots.
PF-30-S01 briefly occupied the slot released by PF-22-S02, but its CorbanuDrive
worktree was lost before implementation. Product authority returned PF-30-S01
to unallocated draft on 2026-09-02 and released that reservation.

The immutable dispatch base is
`43d2d86488d5c1b2eb5cbc401ee8371dbdb76bf4`.

| Lane | Sprint | Owner | Worktree | Branch | Raw midpoint | Integration reserve |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Protected runtime — completed | PF-22-S02 | `/root/pf22_protected_runtime` | `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/p0-security-protected-runtime` | `feat/p0-security-protected-runtime` | 5.0 days | 5.0 days |
| Isolated broker | PF-27-S04 | `/root/pf27_isolated_broker` | `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/p0-security-isolated-broker` | `feat/p0-security-isolated-broker` | 12.0 days | 4.9 days |
| Source envelope — lost allocation | PF-30-S01 | unallocated | `/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/p0-security-source-envelope` (absent) | unallocated | 7.0 days | 4.4 days |

PF-22 consumes four cross-lane contracts and owns the first Core/manifest
convergence. PF-27 consumes the platform/event/capability contracts and requires
all-OS evidence. PF-30's forecast is provisional until the integrated PF-22
contract freezes its ingress seam. The reserve values apply the plan formula
and include one convergence day per implementation handback; reforecast after
PF-22 and PF-27 scope audits.

PF-22 exclusively owns its recorded effective-policy, protected-runtime, Core
module/manifest and lock surfaces. PF-27 owns the secret-broker, credential-
broker, Vault capability, new broker-client/config leaves and its evidence; it
does not edit `core/src/security/mod.rs`, Core/root manifests or shared locks.
The integration owner merged and archived PF-22 first. PF-27 is next rebased
and receives its serialized Core/Vault/network-proxy registrations before the
combined-tree rerun. PF-30 is draft and owns no write scope after its lost
allocation; a future allocation must re-establish disjoint scope and serialized
module, manifest, lock, navigation, and archive ownership.

PF-27 construction uses the PF-27-S03 platform candidates without claiming
protected eligibility: Linux dedicated UID/service, macOS launchd/XPC helper,
and Windows service SID/AppContainer with authenticated named pipe. Final
platform acceptance remains fail closed and requires measured macOS, Linux and
Windows evidence. The user will switch tailnets when local final-tree tests and
Opus remediation are stable; no lane attempts remote qualification earlier.

The checked dispatch packet is
[`parallel-handoffs-2026-08-31-round-4`](../../../qa/security-levels/planning/parallel-handoffs-2026-08-31-round-4/README.md).
Every implementation handback requires formatting, affected tests, a supporting
real TMUX smoke and read-only Claude Opus 5 Max review through Corbanu Terminal.
PF-26 final true-TUI, live-repository and human acceptance remain separate.

## Useful code references

## Current security allocation — 2026-09-11

Travis completed PF13 human testing and authorized its main merge and resumption.
Verified main `d870c92dab2bf3fbb602dc3b8447fe9f3534aecb` includes both the accepted
provider/security work and the actual 0.1.42 release branch. This amendment
supersedes historical multi-lane reservations below: **one** security sprint,
PF-27-S04, is in progress under `/root`, in the new exact worktree above.
Accounting and Task Node retain the other two plan slots; PF35 remains external
and draft, with no engineering slot or bypassed downstream dependency.

Resume only the existing broker service substage from pushed `cd7457da7`:
reconcile construction/EINTR and its synthetic subprocess tests onto main,
preserve default-denial, and verify the combined stage on RTX. Root serializes
the declared Cargo/Bazel/lock, broker, plan and evidence surfaces and coordinates
any overlapping requests with the other integration owners. No new TUI surface
is added, so no new blind UX design is applicable; retain existing UI proof and
exercise synthetic service lifecycle via TMUX.

Five broker reviews were already spent. Travis explicitly approved **one sixth
Fable 5.1 High review through Corbanu/TMUX**, not an additional PF58 review or
privileged setup. Freeze this reconciled stage, inspect any finding, and retain
the existing review ledger. Service installation, principals, ACL/ownership
changes and real Vault migration remain unapproved. Native containment,
production data-plane/streaming and all-OS gates still prevent sprint completion
or protected activation. See the [resume handoff](../../../qa/security-levels/planning/parallel-handoffs-2026-09-04-round-5/RESUME-20260911.md).

Service-stage closeout: review six found no runtime/security issue and one
test-helper Clippy finding. The latter was reproduced and fixed without changing
production code; strict lint, affected suites and supporting TMUX all pass.
Six reviews are now spent. [Final evidence and disposition](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/resume-20260911/README.md)
retain the original nonzero review result. PF-27-S04 remains in progress; the
next implementation consumes PF20's trusted-child/native-root contract, with
new independent review and actual privileged setup requiring their respective
explicit allowances. No production bootstrap or platform completion is inferred.

Subsequent September 11 budget amendment: Travis grants five additional PF27
review slots, replenishing to five every six hours, with history retained in the
[review ledger](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/review-budget.md).
Proceed within the same allocation with the bounded
[trusted-child admission/lifetime stage](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/bootstrap-next-20260911.md):
service-owned child handles, role/generation routing, bounded admission and
failure/shutdown fencing, with unprivileged subprocess/TMUX evidence. Literal
runtime scope is `codex-rs/secret-broker-service/`; existing shared build scope
remains serialized. No PF20 API widening, Core policy factory, Vault hookup,
identity dropping or native installation is included. Default exit78 remains.
This supersedes the earlier service-only execution instruction and budget hold,
not any deployment, containment, data-plane or sprint-completion gate.

This bounded child-admission/lifetime source stage is now qualified at
`bd70f0e6b`: final default3/synthetic13/affected338, strict lint/parity and
TMUX13+exit78 pass. Astra7/Fable8 findings were repaired; Fable9 is clean.
[Closeout evidence](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/child-admission-20260912/README.md)
retains failed/retried runs and review dispositions. Three new slots used;
the six-hour ledger governs later work. PF27-S04 remains in progress, with
actual PF20 root wiring, native setup/containment and provider data-plane still
open. No new principal, service or protected activation was installed.

Next bounded source allocation is the [existing-root composition adapter](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/root-composition-next-20260912.md):
`secret-broker-service/src/root.rs`, separate `root_tests.rs`, library exports,
one Linux dependency on existing `codex-protected-state`, and serialized lock
parity within PF27's existing scope. Connect owned `TrustedChildRun` roles to
unchanged PF20 existing-only factories and `serve_child`; preserve default exit78.
The linked launch/argv/FD target is a subsequent synthetic probe contract, not
implemented syntax or native deployment authority. No PF20/Core/Vault changes,
identity dropping, listener creation or enrollment in this adapter step.
Coordinate shared registrations with the other integration owners before edits.

Existing-root adapter source `794080a4f` is construction-qualified: default3,
synthetic17, affected356 (two existing subprocess-helper skips), scoped strict
Clippy, parity and TMUX17+exit78 pass. Astra10 clean; Fable11 found no runtime
issue and one publication finding resolved by tracking the logs. Full transitive
Clippy fails on inherited codex-api telemetry debt, retained for manager triage.
[Exact proof and limits](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/root-composition-20260912/README.md).
Five review slots used this window. Actual launcher, native qualification and
provider data plane remain open; the adapter is not called by normal startup.

Next source allocation: [synthetic post-exec probe preparation](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/probe-next-20260912.md),
service `src/probe/`, separate test modules and `tests/probe_lifecycle.rs`, optional
binary registration and existing rustix thread feature/lock parity. Inspection
changes only its own non-root process's hardening state and always reports native
eligibility false. All native-launch modes deny; no root socket, identity change,
enrollment, Core/PF20/Vault edit or installation. Source/tests can be prepared
within the existing allocation; independent review must respect the six-hour
budget. Later actual launcher/group/FD contract remains separately bounded.

Post-exec probe source now passes final RTX default3/fixture23/affected356
(two inherited helper skips), scoped lint/parity/build and private TMUX proof.
[Checkpoint](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/probe-20260912/CURRENT.md)
is construction-accepted after Astra12 exit0 and Fable13 exit1 (patch correct,
sole P3 fixture Python-path portability explicitly deferred by integration owner).
Manager granted +2 scoped reviews without resetting history and cleared a main
window. Source remains unchanged; qualification is RTX-only, not all-Linux/Bazel
or native eligibility. No additional unchanged-source review is required.

Implemented allocation: [launcher recipe and post-exec identity preparation](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/launcher-next-20260912.md).
Same PF27-S04 owner/worktree; distinct principals and exact supplementary groups
are preserved using a single-threaded trusted child bootstrap with safe nix
setgroups/setresgid/setresuid calls after exec, not unsafe pre-exec hooks.
Root manifest/pinned execution, actual supervisor/listener/client wiring and
privileged installation remain separate. Source `f0b1209e0` passes RTX default3,
synthetic29, affected356 (2 existing skips), scoped lint/parity/build/TMUX;
Astra14 and Fable15 both exit0 with no findings. Two of manager's +3 extension
used, one unused. [Exact evidence and native limits](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/launcher-20260912/README.md).

Next allocation accepted by the receiving owner for bounded implementation:
[root manifest and executable inspection](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/manifest-next-20260912.md).
Same PF27-S04 owner and coordinates; strict bounded fixed-path schema, checked
opened ancestry/files and streaming image digest, with private test seams.
September12 manager acceptance is recorded in the packet. No spawn, privileged installation,
loader/exec-binding proof, listener, native client or protected activation is
included. Preserve the unused review contingency; reserve any new stage passes
under the existing ledger only after acceptance. Accepted launcher checkpoint
is on main at `cc931adf6333e8348e03ee5fc801c77548aec138`; no repeat review needed.
Manifest inspection source `099fa6f6d` is now construction-qualified: RTX
default3/synthetic35/affected356 (2 existing skips), scoped lint/parity/build/TMUX
pass; Astra16/Fable17 exit0, no findings. [Checkpoint and retained initial fixture
failures](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/manifest-20260912/README.md).
Two new review passes used, prior contingency retained. Main window still
required; no root-positive, exec-binding, loader-trust or native-eligibility claim.

Manifest checkpoint subsequently landed on main at `2c7c4e6c0`; window released.
The accepted [sealed-image preparation](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/sealed-image-next-20260912.md)
is construction-qualified in source `ee1ac023c`: bounded Linux memfd copy, verified
seals and destination hash, with no public descriptor or execution surface.
RTX default3/synthetic39/affected356 (2 existing skips), scoped lint/parity/build
and actual-key TMUX passed; Astra18/Fable19 exit0/no findings. See
[exact evidence](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/sealed-20260912/README.md).
Dynamic loader trust, exec binding, spawn supervision and installation authority
remain separate gates. Sealed checkpoint `140e094ad` landed and its window was
released. The receiving owner accepted [static-probe build-only feasibility](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/static-probe-next-20260912.md),
not a release strategy change: isolated RTX prerequisites and QA only, no source,
dependency or service changes, no artifact invocation. One existing contingency
is allocated to its evidence check; history1–19 remains intact. Initial build101
is retained; owner accepted one unchanged-graph retry with private pinned static
OpenSSL3.5.8, target-scoped settings and no artifact invocation. Its prerequisite
build stopped2 before Cargo on missing linux/mman.h; a second explicit amendment
allows private authenticated userspace UAPI headers and same-prerequisite retry,
not graph changes or weakened checks. That build passed but linkage rejected the
musl-gcc injected interpreter. Pinned rust-lld corrected final linkage while
preserving PIE: dev artifact f6ca8e3368dc passes size, noPT_INTERP/noDT_NEEDED and
GNU negative-control checks through actual-key TMUX; source/locks unchanged.
Fable20 exit1/patch correct identified one P3 rejected-artifact receipt gap,
resolved by exact RTX hash/size capture without another review. All failures
remain preserved. [Final proof and limits](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/static-probe-20260912/CURRENT.md).
This is build feasibility, not a release/static-runtime strategy decision or
execution authority. No main window is granted.

## Round-five execution amendment — 2026-09-04

The user authorized these three parallel agents and assigned integration to
Codex /root. This amendment supersedes earlier dispatch and reviewer instructions
for this round. The immutable source base is `07791288b6feeccfaee5a57c12452359cc666957`,
including the reconciled provider UX. The separate committed allocation packet
is applied before implementation; base is not a claim of qualification.

PF-35-S01's engineering reservation is returned to draft with an external handoff,
as permitted by the sprint process. Its independently operated corpus campaign
remains pending/in progress externally, not cancelled or completed. Do not change
that external checkout or relax PF-35-S02/S03 or protected-mode qualification gates.
It is not a dependency of the three engineering lanes below.

| Lane | Sprint | Owner | Worktree suffix / branch suffix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Broker | PF-27-S04 | /root/broker | security-round5-broker |
| Provenance | PF-30-S01 | /root/provenance | security-round5-provenance |
| Security view | PF-24-S01 | /root/security_ui | security-round5-ui |

Exact coordinates are in front matter and literal scopes in each sprint.
The coordinator owns shared module exports, Cargo/Bazel/lock registration,
plan/navigation, humanTest.html, securityProgress.html and the review ledger.
Worker-owned crate manifests are proposed by the worker; shared edges are
serialized by the coordinator. No two agents edit the same checkout.

PF-27 starts by recovering reviewed leaves, then implements the digest-bound
PF-41 adapter and real Linux IPC evidence. Raw paths must not be added to the
minimized shared audit schema. Native service/data-plane and all-OS qualification
remain required; intermediate commits do not complete or activate the broker.
PF-30 starts with immutable envelopes and trusted admission, then native ingress
and provider seams; contract-only tests do not complete its existing checklist.
Provenance also owns `codex-rs/core/src/session/session.rs` for the narrow client
admission-policy builder hook and `codex-rs/core/src/client_tests.rs` for actual
provider wire tests; no other lane owns these paths. Keep ResponseItem and
provider-owned passthrough schemas unchanged. Missing protected admission or
screening fails closed; configured intent does not establish effective readiness.
PF-30 review remediation additionally owns `core/src/realtime_conversation.rs`
and `core/src/realtime_conversation_tests.rs` under codex-rs. Guard the direct
realtime websocket path as well as WebRTC using the same effective-policy
admission rule; prove no network admission in protected/unavailable states.
Keep Permissive unchanged and inspect live policy changes on an existing stream.
This closes a provider-route omission; it does not activate protected realtime.
PF-24 delivers observation-only requested/effective-state UX. No activation,
grants or downgrade mutations are introduced; unavailable protection is explicit.

Builds and compilation run only on the authorized RTX host. Mac storage stays on
CorbanuDrive. Use actual-key TMUX tests for interactive changes and supporting
TMUX smokes for the other lanes. Review engines are Astra High for autoreview
and Fable 5.1 High through Corbanu Terminal's TMUX harness externally.
Each lane has a maximum of five review invocations unless critical findings
continue; normally one of each engine, with warranted remediation follow-ups.
The coordinator allocates numbered reviews and retains immutable results.

Reserve at least 35% of delivery capacity for integration and qualification.
Existing broker/provenance midpoint estimates (12/7 days) remain uncertain
historical inputs, not new completion promises. Reforecast from observed work
and platform gaps at each handback; do not suppress outstanding evidence to fit
a schedule. The coordinator monitors agent progress every 15 minutes.

### Code reference table

### Rolling pipeline allocation — 2026-09-04

The user authorized keeping freed agent slots occupied until a substantial
human-testable checkpoint. PF-24-S01 is archived. Continue PF-27-S04 service
composition and PF-30-S01 ingress completion, and allocate PF-30-S04 to the
freed agent as a separate **denial-only stage-one memory dispatch boundary**.
Its prerequisite is completed PF-22-S02, not an unfinished screening interface:
all protected raw-rollout requests deny independently of PF-30-S01 admission.
PF-30-S02 still owns full persisted lineage and retains its existing dependencies.
No dependency is waived and PF-35 stays external.

PF-30-S04 uses the exact new memory-dispatch coordinates in front matter.
It exclusively owns core/src/client.rs and core/src/session/mod.rs under
codex-rs, removed from PF-30-S01 before dispatch. Core lib/codex_thread factory
exports and test registries are serialized by the coordinator. Other scopes
remain disjoint. Adopt the host-owned opaque factory/typed denial design in
qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-30-S04, including dispatch-time retries, identity,
live policy and finite worker retry behavior; no public policy setter.

PF-27-S04 additionally owns codex-rs/secret-broker-service/ for composition of
broker/Vault/audit without a cycle. Trusted bootstrap handles and synthetic
subprocess evidence are allowed. Creating principals, installing services,
changing ownership/ACLs or transferring existing Vault material still requires
separate explicit setup authority. Streaming/output qualification remains open.

PF-30-S01 continues complete-input/unknown-source/mixed-source/provider envelope
work only within its remaining scope. New shared hooks are proposed to root,
not patched concurrently with PF-30-S04. Producer fixtures cannot manufacture
production screening readiness.

Current reservation owners: broker /root/broker, provenance /root/provenance,
memory-dispatch /root/security_ui. The previous UI allocation is historical.
New memory track review budget is five maximum; prior broker/provenance review
ledgers remain visible and are not reset. Consolidate source and tests before
requesting the coordinator's next numbered review.

| Path or symbol | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-rs/tui/src/slash_command.rs::SlashCommand` | Adds `/security` to the command surface |
| `codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/slash_dispatch.rs` | Routes `/security` to its TUI |
| `codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/permission_popups.rs` | Existing permission UX patterns; security levels must remain distinct and understandable |

| `codex-rs/vault/src/lib.rs::reveal_for_programmatic_use` | Existing raw-secret helper boundary that PF-13-S04 must gate in Moderate and Aggressive |
| `codex-rs/cli/src/main.rs::run_vault_auth_helper` | Existing supported CLI escape path preserved only for Permissive |
| `codex-rs/network-proxy/src/credential_broker.rs::CredentialBroker` | Existing broker stores `real_value: String`; PF-13-S03 replaces that state on the capability route |
| `codex-rs/network-proxy/src/credential_broker/providers/openai.rs` | First exact provider fixture: HTTPS `api.openai.com:443`, `POST /v1/*`, bearer authorization |
| `codex-rs/network-proxy/src/policy.rs` | Existing egress control composed by Aggressive without overriding an existing denial |
| `codex-rs/{Cargo.toml,Cargo.lock}`, repository-root `MODULE.bazel.lock`, and crate `BUILD.bazel` files | Dependency and Cargo/Bazel parity required in the sprint that changes each crate edge |

## Sprint execution map

This map currently covers **52 current and 32 completed archived sprints**.
The [ordered execution index](../../sprints/current/p0-security-levels/index.md)
is dependency-correct; feature IDs are not execution order. Archive orders 1–9
stay unchanged and current orders start at 10. Existing allocation coordinates
follow upstream; the five preparation/foundation drafts and five new follow-ups
remain `UNALLOCATED` until assigned. PF-27-S03 and PF-34-S04 are completed and
archived; PF-19-S02, PF-20-S02, PF-21-S02, PF-13-S06, and PF-41-S03 are also
completed and archived. PF-35-S01 remains external and `draft`; PF-27-S04 is
the sole security `in_progress` allocation. Other current records are `draft`, with completed
prerequisites and checked allocation required before execution. Archived links
document original scope, not new passes.

### Rolling local-root allocation — 2026-09-04

Product authority selected data-rollback protection, excluding whole-machine
snapshot rollback; see the product specification's **Data-rollback scope
decision — 2026-09-04**. Implement the Linux local-controller root proposed in
[the design](../../../qa/security-levels/planning/parallel-handoffs-2026-09-04-round-5/protected-audit-root-design.md)
under [PF-20-S03](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-20-s03-local-controller-integrity-root.md).
This is a genuine missing PF20 native dependency, not an unfinished PF27 bypass.
Prerequisites PF20S02, PF41S03 and PF27S03 are archived; PF27S04 will consume
the adapter at its separate protected bootstrap/containment gate.

The provenance agent transfers to the exact security-local-anchor coordinates
in front matter. PF30S01 returns to draft, preserving source 2a4fb5857, final
evidence e890ae4a9, integrated 0266c2db9 and its exhausted 5/5 review ledger.
Remaining producer/screening coverage is not completed and no downstream
dependency unlocks. The three current reservations are PF27S04, PF30S04 and
PF20S03. Root owns shared Core exports and workspace Cargo/Bazel/locks; the new
leaf crate, narrow Core anchor adapters and QA are allocated only to PF20S03.
PF27 retains broker/platform access controls and privileged deployment.
No TPM/off-host implementation is needed. No elevated installation or real
Vault migration is authorized by the scope choice; missing protected state
continues to fail closed.

PF20S03 is now completed and archived following combined RTX source `b12e32db3`:
controller18, Core127, audit46, config229, memory44+3, UI235, actual-key TMUX4
and restart passed. No source/formatter/lock delta or additional review.
[Combined evidence](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-20-S03/combined-b12e32d/README.md).
PF30S04 was already archived; only PF27S04 retains an implementation reservation.
Native principal isolation, privileged deployment and protected activation remain
separate gates. Routine human-memory fixture work continues outside sprint capacity.

### PF-13 integration contract

PF-13 uses existing security primitives instead of defining a parallel
capability system. `codex-security-policy` owns secret-free request, actor,
grant, revocation, and receipt types. Core owns human/agent/session/task identity,
policy composition, and the bounded capability lifecycle. Vault resolves an
approved label only inside a zeroizing callback. The network proxy validates the
transport and injects the credential only for `POST https://api.openai.com/v1/*`
using the existing OpenAI bearer header; redirects and adjacent hosts fail.

Permissive retains the shipping `vault auth-helper` and broker behavior.
PF-13-S04 makes that raw-secret helper unavailable to agent execution under
Moderate and Aggressive. PF-27 then moves raw resolution to a separately
constrained process; PF-28 adds reflected-response/output gating, PF-29 adds
safe migration and PF-33 binds actual network connections. PF-13-S05 depends
on those completed boundaries before collecting canary/independent-review proof.
The original in-process slice alone is not the final protected-mode guarantee. PF-26-S03 updates finished vault/authentication guidance
only after candidate acceptance.

## Expanded feature contracts

These are unfinished contracts authorized for planning/execution through their
individual sprints, not claims of shipped behavior. New crate/module paths in
sprints are explicitly planned; validate actual foundation paths in the recorded
implementation worktree before readiness. Add Cargo/Bazel parity in the owning
sprint. [Source decisions](../security-source-reconciliation.md) are authoritative
for design provenance; product scope remains in the specification.

awaits manager disposition/integration, not execution authority.

**Isolated credential broker and secretless launch.** One trusted broker owns raw credential resolution and a bounded authenticated IPC surface. All model/exec/child/MCP/plugin/hook/provider-pane launch paths use a secretless allowlist and OS restrictions; unsupported platform containment prevents protected activation.

### PF-28

**Central output and reflected-secret protection.** One broker-side output registry/gate covers managed values and supported encodings, short secrets, chunks, active rotations, reflected responses and every persistence/export sink. Resource pressure or unsupported response decoding denies; it never evicts protection for live credentials.

### PF-29

**Protected-mode inventory and human migration.** Inventory only scoped supported sources without leaking their values. Human preview binds migration to exact file identities; use encrypted vault/recovery storage, atomic journal, re-audit and clean-context handling for contaminated histories. Cancel is inert; failure cannot claim activation.

### PF-30

**Durable provenance and post-taint authority.** Trusted ingress assigns immutable source/authority/lineage envelopes. Propagate conservative taint through every provider serialization, summary, memory, cache/import/export, child/mailbox and resume path. Re-evaluate protected actions at use; neither a detector nor a summarizer creates authority.

Completed independent denial contract: [PF-30-S04 combined qualification](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-30-S04/combined-qualification.md).
Merged source 6a6bb029d passed Core110, memory44+3, UI235 and four actual-key
TMUX tests on RTX after clean fix/format. The sprint is archived; full persistent
provenance and positive protected inference remain incomplete under S01/S02.
Its completed runtime-policy prerequisite does not authorize positive protected
memory; S01/S02/S03 keep their original source and persistence qualification gates.

### PF-31

**Isolated retrieval and download promotion.** Pin a Scrapling-class public retrieval artifact and isolate it from workspace/vault/wallet/browser profiles/IPC with bounded resources and egress. Fetch/open/click/find cannot fall back to the host browser. Downloads are sealed until exact human digest/destination promotion, which preserves taint and does not execute.

### PF-32

**Screened web facade and search providers.** Keep web.run semantics in Permissive; protected modes use one normalized screened facade. Implement the existing SearchClient adapter plus Exa, Brave and SearXNG with minimal queries, stable references, explicit capabilities, cost limits and already-authorized same-role failover. Native search that cannot be screened before model access is disabled.

### PF-33

**Destination validation and connection enforcement.** Enforce scheme/host/port/method/path and all resolved addresses at redirects, retries and actual connections; prevent rebinding, private-network/metadata access and direct socket/proxy/QUIC escape. A human-configured exact self-hosted search service is a narrow adapter exception, not arbitrary private fetch.

### PF-34

**Sanitization quarantine and safe review.** Render-aware cleaning strips hidden/non-body and unsafe control content, preserving raw/sanitized digests and immutable provenance. Encrypted bounded quarantine enforces allow/rescan/quarantine/reject before model visibility, with safe human review and restart recovery. Cleaned or released content remains untrusted.

### PF-35

**Local classifier and blind qualification.** Ship a licensed, reproducible, offline CPU detector with leakage-free evaluator-owned holdouts and profile-calibrated thresholds. Screen complete bounded inputs before exposure. Missing artifacts/timeouts pause ingestion in Moderate and Aggressive; forced false negatives still cannot authorize secrets or financial actions.

Travis Good's September 11, 2026 decision supersedes the August 30 local
Qwen/vLLM generation route: generate the synthetic-first, commercial-safe English
dataset using the **DeepSeek API through Corbanu Terminal**. Fine-tuning remains
on the **RTX PRO 6000**; production detector inference remains offline on CPU.
API generation does not require local generator weights, a vLLM server, or
stopping ComfyUI. No automatic local-generator or alternate-provider fallback.

Before the campaign, record the actual Corbanu build/provider route, DeepSeek
model ID and any exposed revision, prompt/config hashes, supported sampling
settings, request identities and output hashes. Do not invent immutable hosted
weights, seed support or deterministic replay; preserve accepted outputs and
record provider model drift. Verify endpoint, output-use/data terms and approved
pilot/full-campaign spend and concurrency bounds before paid requests. Use the
existing protected credential path, never keys in prompts or logs. Only synthetic
or licensed public inputs may leave for generation; no secrets, customer/protected
financial data, existing blind records or labels. Independently generated blind
material remains exclusively in the custodian's lane. Replace the preparation
manifest's local-generator placeholder under a separately allocated implementation
scope before accepting campaign evidence; this amendment changes no schema and
claims no API run.

A separately custodied encrypted blind corpus and Intel N100/16 GiB/x86-64 Linux
remain the qualification boundaries. DeBERTa-v3-xsmall exported to signed INT8
ONNX Runtime is the primary detector path, with a custom lightweight classifier
only if the primary cannot meet quality and resource gates. One calibrated
score maps through two signed thresholds to allow/suspicious/hostile;
unavailable is deterministic runtime state. The offline Ed25519 root authorizes
a rotating release key, and immutable GitHub Release assets install atomically
with local verification and rollback. The initial accepted-corpus target is
approximately 250,000 training, 25,000 development/calibration and 150,000
evaluator-owned blind records. Unsupported languages fail closed. Risk-triggered
adjudication starts with complete disagreement/uncertainty review plus
stratified 1% human and separate 1% Opus audits; reassess scalability after the
first 10,000 accepted records without weakening the blind qualification gates.

### PF-36

**Optional hosted detector and safe fallback.** Build the optional hosted interface/consent and evaluation path without selecting or purchasing a vendor. Enable only a qualified named service with approved data terms and cost cap; otherwise record disabled-no-qualified-vendor. Outages use an already-qualified local detector or pause. This optional disposition cannot waive required local qualification.

### PF-37

**Origin-bound browser login and human handoff.** Use a separate origin-bound credentialed browser session, not the public retrieval worker or host profile. Broker fills only an adapter-reviewed login form; raw passwords/cookies never reach the model. Qualify a deterministic fixture and one human-selected permitted HTTPS origin with a non-production test account; record the exact origin/form contract before sprint readiness. MFA/passkeys/CAPTCHA remain human-only, sensitive keystrokes unrecorded, and cancellation/revocation destroys pending session authority. Additional origins remain denied until reviewed.

### PF-38

**Typed financial execution and exact effects.** Adapt existing wallet operations and a fake venue, not a new trading integration. Typed canonical requests and atomic limits precede complete-effect simulation/preview. Reuse PF-16–19 mandates; sign and broadcast are separate, exact-human-approved operations in Aggressive. Durable idempotency/status recovery prevents blind replay after uncertain submission.

### PF-39

**Derived financial views and disclosure control.** Account reads stay trusted; model-visible outputs are purpose/precision/expiry-limited derived values with reconstruction budgets. Apply typed disclosure checks to provider payloads, search, tools, social/email, artifacts, clipboard/export and child messages; operational credentials/custody material cannot be disclosed above Permissive.

### PF-40

**Agent Sweep and safe recovery.** Use secret-free tamper-evident behavior events and deterministic anomaly rules to pause/revoke/kill. An optional isolated reviewer receives only sanitized events and cannot grant authority. Human recovery requires fresh scoped authority and preserves taint, audit and irreversible-action status across restart.

### PF-41

**Effective security inspector and audit.** First provide shared versioned event IDs, durable commit/failure and recovery contracts in PF-41-S03; inspector/export integration stays later. Display requested versus actual level/backend/isolation/egress, broker/classifier readiness, leases/grants/expiry, taint, denials, retention and audit integrity. Degradation must be visible. Human support exports are minimized and disclosure-gated; an integrity gap cannot be hidden behind a healthy badge.

### Profile and failure contract

| Surface | Permissive | Moderate | Aggressive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Existing approvals/sandbox/tool rules | Frozen baseline | Compose existing denials with new policy | Same, never weaken |
| Credentials/agent environment | Existing supported behavior | Broker only; no raw managed secrets in agent env/context | Same plus narrow expiring credential-use grants |
| Protected financial data | Existing policy | Only scoped derived values | Derived views denied until explicit narrow grant |
| Public retrieval/search | Existing route/history/native behavior | Isolated fetch and screened authorized search | Same plus explicit provider/destination grants |
| Ingestion/provenance | Existing behavior | Sanitize, screen, durable taint | Stricter threshold; missing provenance rejects |
| Local classifier unavailable | No new control | Pause external ingestion | Pause external ingestion |
| Optional hosted detector/reviewer | No automatic activation | Explicit data/cost consent and qualification | Same plus narrow disclosure/egress grants |
| Login/challenges/downloads | Existing workflows | Exact-origin broker login; human challenges/promotion | Same plus explicit narrow access |
| Financial operations | Existing policy | Typed limits, complete effect and required mandate | Default deny; exact human approval for each sign and broadcast |
| Clipboard/export/egress | Existing policy | Typed disclosure gate; raw secrets denied | Denied until exact eligible derived-data grant |
| Broker/backend/migration failure | Existing behavior | Block activation or affected protected work | Same; never downgrade automatically |
| Revocation/restart | Existing policy | Durable stop, fresh revalidation | Same; no stale grant/session restoration |

The implementation must version the resolved profile bundle and record effective
sandbox, network, browser, protected-data, lease, ingress, inheritance, retention
and audit settings. Atomic transition previews use that effective bundle, not
only the three-level name. A partially implemented draft is not eligible to
advertise a working protected mode.

### Local classifier qualification targets

Retain the researched targets from the historical proposal as this feature's
qualification baseline, not a new repository-wide policy or a detector guarantee.
PF-35-S01 records the exact weakest supported CPU and evaluation manifests before
training; threshold/resource changes require product review before acceptance.

| Measure | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Benign false positives | ≤0.1% on ≥100,000 held-out benign segments, with confidence interval |
| Known-family detection | ≥80% at that low-FPR operating point |
| Unseen-source/evasion detection | ≥65% at the same threshold; every miss remains policy-contained |
| Benign position/trigger perturbations | ≤2 percentage-point rejection increase |
| CPU envelope | p95 ≤50 ms per 2,048-token segment; peak RSS ≤512 MiB; model ≤300 MiB |
| Privacy | No real customer secrets/protected financial records in corpus, hosted payloads, metrics or artifacts |
| Deterministic safety | All critical unauthorized-disclosure/action cases deny, including forced detector misses |

Long inputs must be bounded and screened across segment boundaries. Measure
end-to-end latency as well as per-segment speed; the model cannot receive a
streamed prefix while screening is pending. A failed required target remains
incomplete; do not substitute a wrapper heuristic or optional hosted service.

## Acceptance flows

| Flow | Starting state | User action | Expected visible result | Pass criterion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Existing-user compatibility | Pre-feature config and representative workflows | Upgrade and continue without opening `/security` | Level is Permissive; behavior is unchanged | Policy snapshots, approval decisions, and workflow outcomes match the baseline |
| Open and cancel | Any level | Open `/security`, highlight another level, press `Esc` | Tab closes and current level remains | No config, session, child-agent, or audit state changes |
| Select Moderate | Permissive | Select Moderate; pass preflight/migration, inspect differences, confirm | Effective Moderate appears only when all required components are ready | Active/future agents enforce the complete profile; unsupported routes fail visibly and one redacted change event is recorded |
| Moderate hostile input | Moderate; untrusted page, file, or tool output contains instructions | Ask the agent to process it | Normal analysis may continue; secret, protected-data, policy-change, and protected-action requests are blocked | No protected value or unauthorized action reaches model-visible output or execution |
| Select Aggressive | Moderate | Select Aggressive and confirm | Sensitive surfaces show denied-by-default state and grant affordances | All listed sensitive paths deny until a human grants narrow access |
| Aggressive temporary grant | Aggressive | Grant one sensitive action with scope and expiry | Only that action becomes available; scope and expiry remain visible | Adjacent tool, account, destination, child agent, and post-expiry attempts fail |
| Downgrade | Aggressive with a pending grant or approval | Select Permissive and confirm the protection-removal summary | Downgrade applies and incompatible pending authority is invalidated | No old grant or approval can be replayed |
| Restart/resume | Moderate or Aggressive with kill switch or revocation active | Restart Corbanu and resume the session | Level and restrictive state are restored | No transient fallback to Permissive and no stale approval restoration |
| Agent tries policy change | Any level | Prompt or tool output asks Corbanu to weaken security | Request is treated as untrusted content | No policy mutation path is available to the agent |
| Secret migration | Permissive with synthetic legacy auth/history | Dry-run, cancel, confirm, inject failure, recover | Values never shown; protected activation waits for clean state | No plaintext rollback and no contaminated resume |
| Allowed-host reflection | Protected broker with fake provider | Send a credentialed request that reflects the credential | Redacted response or bounded denial | Canary absent from model/tool/log/stream/artifact sinks |
| Poisoned memory | Protected mode | Read hostile text, summarize, store, spawn child and resume | Original untrusted lineage persists | Forced benign detector result still cannot grant authority |
| Screened web failure | Protected web.run | Search/fetch, fail provider/worker/classifier | Safe permitted same-role retry or visible pause | No native-search or host-browser bypass |
| Quarantine/download | Suspicious page or file | Inspect, cancel, rescan or approve exact promotion | Esc is inert; content remains tainted | No active raw rendering, uncontrolled write or auto-execution |
| Brokered login | Fake exact-origin credentialed session | Approve login, handle human challenge, revoke | No password/cookie in model or recorded input | Wrong origin and stale session deny across restart |
| Financial effect | Fake wallet/venue | Preview, sign, separately approve broadcast; simulate timeout | Complete expected effect and honest uncertain status | No mutation, duplicate transfer or blind resubmission |
| Derived-data disclosure | Synthetic protected portfolio | Request view/export, cancel, grant exact permitted view | Only authorized derived data leaves trusted boundary | Reconstruction, raw portfolio and secret export deny |
| Sweep/inspector | Active protected task | Trigger anomaly; inspect runtime; recover and restart | Actual degradation, stop and fresh-authority requirements visible | Old grants remain revoked and audit is secret-free |

## Standards-derived acceptance contract

| Contract | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Deterministic decision | Every protected operation produces a typed subject/resource/action/context request and allow/deny result outside the model; malformed or incomplete requests deny visibly |
| Narrow delegation | A child agent receives no more authority than its parent; the record preserves both the human principal and acting-agent chain |
| Bounded grant | A temporary grant names its action, resource, destination, quantitative limits, and expiry; changing any bound field or using it for an adjacent operation fails |
| Exact human intent | The trusted TUI presents a canonical action preview and binds approval to it; mutation, replay, duplicate submission, and stale approval fail and produce secret-free receipts |
| Immediate invalidation | Downgrade, revocation, kill switch, and risk events invalidate cached decisions, active grants, and pending approvals before another protected operation can start and remain effective after restart |
| Threat coverage | A versioned OWASP crosswalk maps every applicable agentic risk to a prevention control, automated or adversarial case, true-TUI flow where interactive, result, and artifact |

## Implementation sequence

Use the [52-record current index](../../sprints/current/p0-security-levels/index.md)
for exact dependencies. Bounded parallel allocations follow the sprint process;
reading order is not a serial lock. Including 24 completed archives, the graph
has 76 nodes; exact merged-tree ordering is maintained by the checked current
index rather than inherited historical snapshot arithmetic.

1. **Prepare independent boundaries and reconcile foundations.** Allocate up to
   three checked workers: platform/foundation, browser artifact/destination policy,
   and segment/classifier preparation. Complete the new contract sprints before
   consumers; do not enable any protected path from fixtures alone.
   **Build only the remaining foundation guarantees.** Preserve PF-15–22/PF-13-S01
   completions; PF-13-S06 and PF-19/20/21/22-S02 carry the newly accepted requirements.
2. **Complete the first credential boundary.** PF-13-S02–S04 and S06 extend accepted capabilities,
   resolver and OpenAI substitution. PF-27/28/33 add process, output and connection
   guarantees. PF-24-S01 provides the initial honest profile view; PF-29 adds
   preflight/migration. PF-13-S05 then independently qualifies that complete boundary.
   PF-41-S03 supplies durable event/commit/recovery contracts before runtime,
   broker, quarantine, financial and Sweep consumers, without waiting for audit UI.
3. **Make authority durable and usable.** PF-30 adds provenance/memory/post-taint
   checks; PF-23 composes profiles, PF-24-S02 confirms safe transitions and PF-25
   provides grants/stop/recovery. Missing future adapters remain denied.
4. **Build protected research.** PF-31 isolation, PF-34 cleaning, PF-35 local
   qualification, then PF-34 quarantine/review and PF-32 screened provider adapters.
5. **Qualify optional detection.** PF-36 adds consent, a fake-service contract and
   measured hosted disposition; no commercial vendor is assumed.
6. **Complete protected workflows.** PF-37 login/human handoff, PF-38 existing-wallet
   execution and PF-39 derived-data/outbound checks reuse the same authority types.
7. **Close operator visibility.** PF-40 Sweep and PF-41 actual-state/audit inspection
   complete stop/recovery/degradation coverage.
8. **Requalify the entire final tree.** PF-26-S01 checks every source requirement,
   old-to-new mapping, standards/threat class and forced-miss regression.
   PF-26-S02 repeats all applicable true-TUI workflows in both live repositories.
9. **Accept and document.** PF-26-S03 requires named human/independent review,
   finished-only guidance and release/benchmark evidence. Planning completeness
   is not implementation, release readiness or a promised ship date.

## Independent functional execution — September 12

The next applicable user-facing handoff follows the mandatory
[isolated execution gate](../../../qa/code-blind-functional/isolated-execution.md).
The named integrator owns packet/isolation provisioning and separate executor
and reviewer assignments; implementation owners do not execute acceptance cases.
Record increment-specific internal-only N/A with later functional gate, not a
plan-wide exemption. Missing isolation is manager work, not unanswered approval.
Existing evidence stays historical; dependencies, feature flags and live authority
are unchanged. See the linked rollout table for this lane's next acceptance.

## Automated evidence

Run fix and formatting tools before the final affected tests.

| Check | Final-tree command | Result | Artifact |

| Final affected tests | `cd codex-rs && just test -p <affected-project>` for each changed project; never direct `cargo test` | pending | `qa/release/<version>/security/final-tests.txt` |

## True-TUI evidence

Use the existing Rust `TmuxServer` harness and `test-tui` skill, `RUST_LOG=trace`,
and an isolated `log_dir`; do not replace the typed driver with shell automation.
PF-26-S01 supplies the local capture proxy/scanner; PF-26-S02 retains the required
Ubuntu lane, named credential-boundary test, zero-retry canary checks and cleanup.
Send
prompt text and Enter separately. `corbanu exec` is not acceptable proof.

| Flow | Test repository | Keys/actions | Visible checkpoints | Result | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Permissive compatibility | TensorCash disposable worktree | Run the frozen baseline workflow; open `/security`; verify Permissive; repeat | Same approvals, tools, output, and persistence before and after | pending | `qa/release/<version>/security/tui/permissive/` |
| Moderate | TensorCash disposable worktree | Select Moderate; confirm; process hostile fixture; attempt protected action; cancel and retry | Level visible; normal work continues; prohibited request blocked; approval state exact | pending | `qa/release/<version>/security/tui/moderate/` |
| Aggressive | Isometric Game disposable worktree | Select Aggressive; confirm; attempt sensitive tool; grant one scoped action; spawn child; wait for expiry | Default denial; one narrow grant; child cannot weaken; expiry removes access | pending | `qa/release/<version>/security/tui/aggressive/` |
| Downgrade/recovery | Isometric Game disposable worktree | Activate kill switch; request downgrade; inspect warning; cancel once, then confirm; restart and resume | Cancel preserves level; confirmation invalidates pending authority; persisted state is coherent | pending | `qa/release/<version>/security/tui/recovery/` |

Additional PF-26-S02 cases use the same final candidate and both applicable live
repositories: migration/corrupt recovery; broker reflection/failure; multi-turn
memory taint; screened web failover/blocked classifier; quarantine and download
promotion; exact-origin login/human challenge; full-effect fake sign/broadcast
with uncertain recovery; derived-data export; Sweep and inspector/audit
degradation. Each has success, cancel/deny, failure, recovery and resume
checkpoints and safe evidence. No real funds or credentials are used.

## Live-repository applicability

| Repository | Applicable? | Qualification record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TensorCash | yes | Permissive compatibility and Moderate protected-action workflow |
| Isometric Game | yes | Aggressive TUI, inheritance, expiry, downgrade, and recovery workflow |

Resolve exact disposable worktree paths and base commits in the release evidence
before qualification.

## Human acceptance

| Tester | Date | Candidate version/commit | Flow | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Named by release owner | pending | pending | Understand levels without explanation; preserve Permissive; use Moderate and Aggressive; cancel and downgrade safely | pending | `qa/release/<version>/security/human-acceptance.md` |

## Documentation

| Finished-feature doc | Product-spec citation present | Verified candidate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/features/security.md`, created only after acceptance | Must cite “P0 `/security` levels” and the Permissive requirement | pending |
| `docs/features/vault.md` and `docs/authentication.md`, updated only after acceptance | Must distinguish Permissive helper behavior from Moderate/Aggressive broker-only resolution and cite “Required trust boundaries” | pending |
| `docs/features/index.md` and `docs/slash_commands.md` | Must expose only candidate-verified `/security` behavior | pending |

## Dependencies, decisions, and blockers

| Item | Owner | Needed by | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Permissive golden baseline | Jim Ricketts | PF-21-S02 / PF-26 | S01 oracle preserved byte-for-byte; S02 independent baseline/upstream/candidate plus protected-boundary controls accepted 36/36; PF-26 live qualification remains pending |
| Existing foundations | Jim Ricketts | Current consumers | PF-15–22 and PF-13-S01 completed/archived upstream; five follow-ups remain draft for added review guarantees |
| Moderate and Aggressive control matrix | Product authority | PF-23 review | Defined in the product specification; any change requires a product decision |
| Persistence and downgrade invalidation | Jim Ricketts | PF-20-S02 / PF-23 | S02 protected authoritative-state and external-anchor contracts accepted; activation remains blocked pending a qualified protected provider and PF-23 runtime transitions |
| LLM security review route | Jim Ricketts | Every sprint candidate and final qualification | Reviewer capacity supplied; use Computer Use with visibly selected Claude Opus 5.0 and Max effort, preserve immutable evidence, verify findings and repeat after accepted fixes |
| Human tester | Release owner | Final qualification | Must be named before acceptance |
| Expanded program capacity and integration allowance | Jim Ricketts / product authority | Execution scheduling | Maximal LLM capacity supplied; provisional 35% integration reserve and per-sprint/gate formula recorded above; three-active-sprint limit remains; October 8 feasibility pending measured estimates, no scope silently removed |
| Platform access and isolation capability matrix | Jim Ricketts | PF-27-S03 completion and PF-27/PF-31 integration readiness | PF-27-S03 three-platform probes are accepted; all measured platforms remain ineligible, and unsupported protected paths block visibly pending real mechanism qualification |
| Moderate workflow usability targets | Product authority / Jim Ricketts | PF-26-S02 readiness | Numeric task-completion, approval-count and latency targets with fixed workflows pending; no relaxation of protection |
| Local detector hardware/corpus/license pins | Jim Ricketts / evaluator | PF-35-S01 | Travis's September 11 decision: DeepSeek API generation through Corbanu Terminal replaces local Qwen/vLLM; fine-tuning stays RTX PRO 6000. Synthetic/open commercial-safe sources, independent custody, N100 floor, DeBERTa/ONNX, signing and distribution unchanged. Actual API model/route, data terms, budget, manifest adaptation and measured evidence remain campaign prerequisites; no API execution claimed |
| Retriever/API/model dependency pins | Jim Ricketts | Owning adapter sprint readiness | Verify then pin current supported artifacts and APIs; historical sources are not fresh release security evidence |
| Optional hosted vendor and data terms | Product authority | PF-36-S02 real-service activation | No vendor selected; interface/fixtures and explicit disabled disposition are in scope |
| First real login origin/test account | Human owner / security reviewer | PF-37-S01 readiness | Record one permitted exact HTTPS origin, reviewed form and non-production account; missing access blocks qualification |
| Additional login/financial adapters | Product authority / security reviewer | Any expansion beyond first reviewed origin/existing wallet | Denied until separately reviewed; no new commercial venue scope |

## Release linkage

- Release record: `qa/release/<version>/` — pending target version.
- Benchmark tracker: repository-root `benchmarks/README.md`, when due for the
  target release.
- Remaining blockers: implementation, unresolved historical full-suite failures,
  final compatibility and adversarial
  evidence, independent security review, true-TUI qualification, and named
  human acceptance.

## Completion

- [ ] Accepted architecture refinements and upstream-seam register have final-tree evidence.
- [ ] Parallel allocations, scope audits and combined-tree integration evidence are complete.

- [x] Original reconciliation snapshot mapped source scope to 52 current and 24 completed single-feature sprints; all 72 cancelled records have explicit dispositions. The current index tracks subsequent completions and additions.
- [ ] Every PF-27–41 contract and protected-mode readiness condition passes final-candidate evidence.
- [ ] Optional hosted/reviewer lanes are explicitly qualified-enabled or disabled with an auditable reason.
- [ ] Permissive compatibility is proven against the frozen pre-feature baseline.
- [ ] Moderate and Aggressive match the product-spec control matrix.
- [ ] Every adopted standards behavior is mapped to passing code, test, and TUI
  evidence without an unsupported conformance claim.
- [ ] Required final-tree automated and adversarial evidence passes.
- [ ] True-TUI and both live-repository workflows pass.
- [ ] No critical security finding remains open.
- [ ] Named human acceptance passes.
- [ ] Finished documentation matches the accepted candidate.
- [ ] Release and due benchmark records are linked.

## Profile, Task Node and Campaign Tracker feature reconciliation

These are existing contracts, not new product authorizations. The
[September 10 identity map](../../sprints/identity-reconciliation-2026-09-10.md)
resolves collisions with Claude-auth PF-42–45 and preserves recorded outcomes,
dependencies, evidence and allocations. Historical IDs are qualified by their
owning plan and record path; they are not global aliases.

| Feature | Contract / acceptance boundary | Sprint | Current disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PF-76 | Durable named-profile provider selection and authorization, restart recovery and profile isolation | [PF-76-S01](../../sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-76-s01-provider-profile-persistence.md) | Draft, unallocated; reconcile against unified-provider shipped evidence before any implementation |
| PF-77 | Profile/server-bound durable Task Node requests, original receipts, stale-response fencing and recovery without account mixing | [PF-77-S01](../../sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-77-s01-tasknode-reliability.md) | Draft; implementation/PTY evidence recorded, natural nonempty production observation still unchecked |
| PF-77 | Multiple-account relink recovery under the same identity boundary | [PF-77-S02](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-77-s02-relink-recovery.md) | Completed bounded repair; does not complete S01's pending observation |
| PF-78 | Attributable campaign capture, permissioned replay and bounded summaries | [PF-78-S01](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-78-s01-campaign-tracker.md) | Completed for recorded local scope; deployment/restore/advanced UI/pilot caveats retained |
| PF-78 | Propagate the active profile to agent Task Node helpers, fail closed on missing/conflicting scope | [PF-78-S02](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-78-s02-agent-profile-scope.md) | Completed repair; historical records are not transferred |

PF-76 cites **Shipping MVP — LIVE**, **Named profiles**: “durably owned by that
profile, restored after restart, and unavailable to other named profiles.”
PF-77 cites the same heading, **Task Node and identity**: “Tasks, evidence,
verification, rewards, balances, chat, context, linked identity”. Its existing
reliability contract is durable account-owned recovery, not a new Task Node
management service. The archived relink repair was performed serially while
S01's observation was returned to draft; it is not retroactively made dependent
on that observation. PF-78's product citation and release limits follow below.
No draft is activated or marked complete by this reconciliation.

## PF-77-S02 — Multiple-account relink recovery

The September 8 user report authorizes repairing multiple Task Node accounts on
one machine. Product heading **Shipping MVP — LIVE**, row **Task Node and
identity**: "Tasks, evidence, verification, rewards, balances, chat, context,
linked identity". The selected profile must retain its own account, a rejected
old token must not shadow a completed relink, and active guidance must name
Corbanu. [PF-77-S02](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-77-s02-relink-recovery.md)
owns the shared resolver, focused two-account tests and real TUI recovery proof.
This extends the existing profile isolation contract, without transferring
historical records or choosing GitHub identities for the user.

## PF-78-S02 agent identity repair — completed

User-reported post-release account mismatch authorizes repairing agent helper profile propagation. [Sprint PF-78-S02](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-78-s02-agent-profile-scope.md) is implemented and locally qualified in `/home/pfrpc/repos/worktrees/corbanu-release-0.1.39`, branch `fix/tasknode-agent-profile-scope`, base `9b71d86d7f`. Its scope is runtime profile inheritance, fail-closed helper resolution and regression/PTY proof; historical records are not transferred.

## PF-78 Campaign Tracker release integration

The user authorized Campaign Tracker implementation on September 6 and production deployment and release on September 7. Product contract: **Campaign Tracker — LOCAL PILOT CANDIDATE**, “preserve attributable user prompts and compact GLM 5.3 Flash summaries in a bounded database”. [PF-78-S01](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-78-s01-campaign-tracker.md) records completed implementation. [0.1.39 publication](../../../qa/release/0.1.39/PUBLICATION.md) records integration with the shipped 0.1.38 baseline and qualification limits. No additional product initiative is introduced by packaging this completed feature.

## PF-82 — Team Context terminal parity

The operator explicitly authorized this extension on 2026-09-11: make the Team Context already visible in Task Node available through Corbanu Terminal and `corbanu-debug --yolo`. Product heading **Shipping MVP — LIVE**, **Task Node and identity**: “Tasks, evidence, verification, rewards, balances, chat, context, linked identity”. This extends the existing Task Node integration with an authenticated read surface; existing task-history grants remain authoritative.

[Sprint PF-82-S01](../../sprints/archive/p0-security-levels/pf-82-s01-team-context.md) owns the CLI, TUI, bridge route and focused acceptance. No dependency on unfinished security features. Worktree coordinates are declared above; the companion server is `/home/pfrpc/repos/tasknode` with its existing unrelated work preserved. Upstream touch: CLI/TUI adapter and event registration only, based on the release candidate `7ae35557657b2f2d1c51a8f4af4e4bb1180fe5eb`; no Core, protocol, dependency, wallet or inference change.

Acceptance: the CLI returns the same permission-filtered report as the web app, the TUI shows summaries/counts/freshness and refresh, unauthorized or revoked relationships expose no work, account switching and stale responses retain existing safeguards, and unavailable reports remain explicit. Verify route grants/auth, CLI JSON, TUI snapshots and real keyboard success/failure/recovery/cancel/restart on the final binary in both recorded disposable default repositories. Target is the local debug candidate; the already-running 0.1.42 release remains pinned to its existing source. Human acceptance and wider benchmarks are recorded separately. Codex owns integration and serializes the combined checks.

PF-82 local debug acceptance completed on 2026-09-11: Terminal `721d6f974d`, Task Node `39e051c` / web release 737. [Verification](../../../qa/reliability/team-context-2026-09-11/README.md) records automated tests, both true-PTY repository workflows and the installed debug launcher. Public release integration is separate.
