# Unified provider onboarding and management

2026-10-10 activation: Travis approved PF-84 named accounts ("Yes, let's hit
multi-account"). The plan takes active slot 2, released when the accounting plan
completed. Only PF-84 is in scope for this activation; PF-58-S01 stays a draft
residual. September 11 history: the plan was deferred under the PF-13/accounting/
Task Node selection; all completed archives and evidence are preserved.

Policy: repository-root `AGENTS.md`

Plan lifecycle: `docs/plans/index.md`

## Activation record

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | **Active** from 2026-10-10 for PF-84; deferred 2026-09-11 to 2026-10-10 |
| Active-plan slot | **2 of 3** (accounting slot, released when that plan completed) |
| Priority | **P1** — current drift is disrupting co-founders and users |
| Product authority | Final product authority — user decision |
| Authoritative decision | Unify onboarding and `/providers` behind one provider catalog, status model, authentication controller, and persisted eligibility policy; retain the merged Claude-auth foundation and its evidence. |
| Accountable owner | Codex primary agent |
| Implementation owner | GPT-5.6 Sol high implementation agent |
| Target release | TBD |
| Deadline | TBD |

This plan continues the active record previously titled **Reliable Claude
subscription authentication**. PF-42 through PF-47 landed on `origin/main` in
`f7356a94e032234022a462d65b576a7de2854859`; their completed sprint records
remain historical evidence. The expanded plan does not reopen those delivered
contracts, represent their unclosed release gates as passed, or consume a third
active-plan slot.

## User pain

September 10 picker follow-up (user: “Please fix these and create regression
coverage”): PF-58 also repairs TUI model-catalog synchronization, exact
provider/model current markers, and asynchronous health refresh. Do not invent
model availability or bypass credential eligibility. Preserve Anthropic API
versus Claude subscription ownership. Add regressions and packaged TMUX proof;
continue Developer ID signing without changing credential ACLs.

Final follow-up evidence: `qa/provider-auth/pf-58/picker-repair-20260910.md`.
The signed native Mac and RTX packages pass catalog/setup/restart TMUX; 58 TUI,
72 provider-auth and 32 Linux integration tests pass. Two unattended Mac
existing-profile menu launches complete with successful Keychain reads.
Human acceptance and the separate documented release/live-platform gates remain open.

September 10 Mac Keychain amendment (user: “Can you fix it?”): PF-58 also
owns `codex-rs/keyring-store/` for bounded native permission prompting. Permit
at most one interactive operation per credential per process; subsequent native
operations must remain fresh reads/writes but fail rather than prompt again.
Do not cache credential values, change Keychain ACLs, erase credentials, or add
fallback storage. A new process resets the interaction budget. Native Mac
builds/tests are authorized by the user's September 8 dual-platform request;
Linux remains the preferred location for portable rebuilds. Verify native
allow/deny/repeated-read behavior and preserve explicit human sign-off gaps.

September 8 repair amendment: the expanded candidate gate exposed a silent
Claude manager recovery cancellation when no credential source is selected.
PF-58 must expose the existing explicit method/replacement choice in this case,
while retaining known-source recovery restrictions and external ownership.
The user's request to fix failing tests authorizes this repair; the adjacent
bounded packaging and native-pane inheritance repairs are recorded separately
under `qa/provider-auth/pf-58/product-repairs-20260908.md`.

2026-09-05 user amendment: identify the credential rejected by `codex_apps`
and generalize actionable reauthentication across providers. PF-58 owns this
follow-up; it does not reopen completed PF-48–PF-57 or activate protected modes.
An enabled provider is not necessarily authenticated. Show credential-specific
health separately from activation/current selection, and offer keyboard recovery
using the existing typed setup adapter. Recoverable expiry should refresh before
requesting human sign-in; rejected refresh requires explicit recovery. Environment,
command, AWS and no-auth/local sources need truthful source-specific guidance,
not an invented browser-login flow. Never silently switch credential, account,
provider, model or billing context. Transient network/rate/permission failures
are not credential revocation. Clear a failure only after matching recovery or
validated success, rejecting stale results from an older credential/turn.

The affected RTX process used its saved ChatGPT account: no connector-token,
OpenAI API-key or Codex API-key environment override was present. Its open state
files identify `~/.corbanu`, not the separate `~/.codex` store. Corbanu's logs
record proactive refresh failures including `refresh_token_reused`; the server
also reported an expired access token. The exact vault token expiry has not been
inspected. An earlier expiry observation from `~/.codex` was not this credential.
No raw token, account identifier or private response is recorded in this plan.

PF-58 owner/integrator is Codex /root in the newly listed worktree. Build/test
registration also covers the existing provider-journey nextest rule
and mechanical Cargo/Bazel lock reconciliation after the requested main merge.
No new dependency or runtime policy is introduced by that registration.
PF-58 retains RTX-only builds and a separate receiving integration boundary. Review allocation for this
new feature is an initial Astra High plus Fable5.1 High Corbanu/TMUX pair,
at most five total, superseding historical PF-56 model choices for PF-58 only.
The security monitor remains paused; no main merge is authorized by this amendment.
The user's 2026-09-05 Luna/Kimi K3 delegation attempt was refused because the
generated authorized-runtime list exposed only Sol and Terra. PF-55-S04 repairs
the native child-runtime catalog/selection boundary under the existing PF-55
provider convergence feature. Preserve explicit provider policy, credential
custody, encrypted-message routing, and exact requested model identity. Prove
real child launches and results in TUI; prior Astra parent tests are not proof.

The user's live Astra test on 2026-09-05 failed with OpenAI's newer-Codex
requirement. PF-55-S02 proved only the selector and loopback transport, not live
account inference. The user now explicitly mandates a working Astra harness,
including any necessary upstream upgrade, repeatable live acceptance and true
TUI proof. PF-55-S03 owns this work. It cannot complete on mocks, a renamed
version header alone, or a substituted model. No publication is authorized.

The user's subsequent 2026-09-05 instruction explicitly adds GPT-6 Astra to the
OpenAI model selector. PF-55-S02 extends the provider/model convergence feature
with one bundled manual model option, documented capabilities and selection,
cancel, restart and request-routing evidence. Existing defaults, automatic
delegation policy, credentials and other providers remain unchanged. This is
not a release-publishing instruction.

The user's 2026-09-05 instruction authorizes PF-57-S03 to reconcile those repairs
with IridiumMaster/Travis's updated `integration/reconcile-release-0.1.37` branch
at `07791288b6feeccfaee5a57c12452359cc666957`. Preserve the provider-login UX,
long-lived Claude token workflow and Ambient's GLM-only catalog change, and
qualify the combined candidate. `origin/main` at `6dd9ad646beb4a7407521439411f436f21ea4af1`
is already an ancestor of that branch. Publication is a separate release action;
the user has been asked whether to publish or hand back the reconciled candidate.

The user's 2026-09-04 instruction authorizes repairing Astra's reconciliation
findings under PF-57: wallet daemon upgrade compatibility, durable Task Node
profile logout, and Corbanu API environment-alias eligibility. This extends the
credential-lifecycle regression scope to the existing Task Node session store;
it does not authorize publication, live payments, or changes to site behavior.
The site/backend API-key flow is reviewed separately without production writes.

First-run onboarding and `/providers` currently maintain separate provider
lists, status rules, persistence decisions, event routes, and completion
behavior. A provider can appear configured in one interface and absent or
unusable in the other. New providers and custom providers must be wired twice,
and the repaired Claude subscription path can regress when one host bypasses it.

This creates repeated authentication work, ambiguous provider state, and direct
productivity loss for co-founders and users.

## Product intent and ideal flow

On a fresh profile, onboarding shows the same provider catalog and metadata-only
status later shown by `/providers`. The user may configure any number of
providers, returning to the list after each setup. Every successfully configured
provider is active by default. **Done** ends the provider phase only when at
least one usable provider exists or a queued Corbanu Plan flow can produce one.

Choosing Corbanu Plan during the provider phase only queues its onboarding and
returns immediately to the list. After **Done**, the wallet/Plan flow runs with
Escape and cancel support. Success makes Corbanu configured and active without
overriding an already usable current provider. Cancellation continues when
another provider is usable; if Corbanu was the only path, it returns to the
provider screen.

On a fresh install, the first successfully configured provider supplies the
initial default model. An existing usable model/provider selection is preserved.
Later configuration expands the eligible model set without silently switching
the current model.

On return visits, `/providers` uses the same catalog, status resolver, and auth
controller. It additionally allows configured providers to be deactivated or
reactivated without deleting credentials. Credential removal is a separate,
clearly labeled action. Deactivating the provider behind the current model
requires the user to choose a usable replacement first.

## Named accounts per provider (PF-84)

2026-10-08 amendment from Travis; activated 2026-10-10. S01 (home-hygiene lane)
and S02 (account-registry lane) run in parallel with disjoint write scopes; S03,
S04, S05 and S06 are allocated when their dependencies are merged behind the flag.

**Requirement.** Support several accounts for any provider. That covers extra API
keys (two Anthropic, OpenRouter or Z.AI keys) and extra subscription logins (two
Claude Plan accounts, two ChatGPT logins). The account can be chosen per session,
per worker or subagent, and from `corbanu exec`. Usage is attributed per account.
A worker the coordinator spawns can use a different account than the coordinator.

**Feasibility (multiacct1, installed 0.1.48, refs at `63ea3d0cbd`).** One home
per account works today. It was proven live for Claude Plan: a fake token in
home2 produced a 401, and the real home was unchanged. It is not a product,
though, for four reasons:

- The stock `~/.local/bin/corbanu` wrapper resets `CORBANU_HOME`, so workers
  silently fall back to account A.
- Each home has its own vault, so other labels (such as the ZAI key) are missing in home2.
- Sessions and usage are split per home.
- In-process subagents cannot switch account.

**Design.**

- An account is `(provider id, name)`. Today's credentials are the implicit
  `default` account, with unchanged labels, so nothing is migrated or reauthenticated.
- Named accounts live in the existing per-home vault under
  `provider/<provider-id>/accounts/<name>/<kind>`, with an encrypted registry.
  The vault key stays the one keychain item `codex`/`secrets|<sha16(home)>`, and
  named accounts add none.
- One resolver per auth kind takes the account:
  - API key: named accounts ignore provider env vars.
  - Claude Plan token: per-account token and selection.
  - Claude Code login: the account stores its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.
  - ChatGPT login: stored in the vault, with no new `Codex Auth` item.
  - `auth.command`: gets `CORBANU_PROVIDER_ACCOUNT`.
  - AWS: `aws.profile` per account.
- Selection precedence: `--account` or the spawn `account` argument, then the
  session choice, then `[provider_accounts]` in config, then `default`. An
  unknown or failed account fails closed. There is never a silent fallback,
  which matches the PF-58 invariant.
- The thread config carries the account. Children inherit it unless the spawn
  overrides it. Resume uses the recorded name. Accounting and rate-limit leases
  are keyed by (provider, account fingerprint).

**Fix items.**

- The wrapper home reset and silent home precedence (PF-84-S01).
- Duplicate provider rows after Claude Plan setup: "Anthropic Claude Account" and
  "Claude Account" were both shown as configured (PF-84-S04).

**Migration.**

- Existing single-account homes keep working byte for byte.
- Per-home workaround homes are not imported automatically, which is consistent
  with "Out". The user re-enrolls the second credential as a named account in the
  main home, then retires the extra home.

**Gate per sprint.**

- `just test` on the affected crates.
- A true-tmux scenario following `docs/tmuxHarness.md`, with disposable homes and
  `CORBANU_TEST_NO_NATIVE_KEYRING=1`.
- A GLM 5.3 Flash run (`-m glm-5.3-flash -c model_provider="zai"`; owner policy
  2026-10-10), with a real `default` ZAI account and a fake-key named account.
  The expected 401 proves the selection. A second provider (OpenAI API key, Kimi
  or Claude Plan) proves the feature is provider-generic.
- Linux clippy `-D warnings` on the RTX host for every slice.

**Delivery rules (2026-10-10).**

- Named-account behaviour ships behind the default-off `named_accounts`
  feature flag (`[features] named_accounts = true`). With the flag off, every code path is today's. A sprint whose code
  is merged behind the flag with its gate evidence recorded is set `ready` for
  independent code-blind acceptance; it is not archived until that acceptance
  and Travis's sign-off. Its successor may proceed under the sprint checker's
  `merged_behind_flag` rule.
- S02 also owns the lowest-precedence selector (`[provider_accounts]` in config,
  so `-c provider_accounts.<id>=<name>` works) and a metadata-only
  `corbanu account list|add|remove` CLI that reads secrets from stdin. Both are
  needed to enroll and exercise accounts before the S04 UI; S03 adds the
  explicit selectors (`--account`, spawn, session, resume).
- S02 amendment (2026-10-10): named OpenAI sign-ins (API-key login, ChatGPT) and AWS
  profiles left S02; selecting such an account fails closed until they ship.
- Decision D4 (Travis, 2026-10-11, chat with the coordinator): option (a). A new
  [PF-84-S06](../../sprints/current/unified-provider-auth/pf-84-s06-aws-and-chatgpt-accounts.md)
  runs after S05: named AWS profile accounts first (slice A), then named
  ChatGPT/OpenAI sign-in accounts (slice B). The other options, (b) AWS only and
  (c) dropping both, were not chosen. This closes the question #423 recorded.

**Decisions (recommended defaults adopted 2026-10-10; Travis may revisit).**
Travis did not answer D1-D3 explicitly when approving the work, so the plan's
recommendations apply: D1 one vault per home with account-qualified labels;
D2 no automatic import from per-home workaround homes; D3 spawned agents may
only name accounts already configured for the target provider, the account is
shown at spawn, and choosing one needs approval under `/security` Aggressive.

**PF-76-S01 reconciliation.** PF-76 (provider selection and sign-in persisted per
named Corbanu config profile) is a different axis from PF-84 (several
credentials per provider in one home). When PF-76 is allocated, a profile's
provider sign-in is stored as a PF-84 named account and the profile selects it
through `[profiles.<name>.provider_accounts]`; PF-76 does not add a second
credential scope. PF-84 does not change profile semantics.

- One independent Opus 5.5 High review.

## Scope

### In

- One typed provider catalog derived from runtime provider configuration plus
  product-owned account and Corbanu Plan entries.
- Automatic inclusion in both hosts of custom providers that declare an API-key
  environment variable.
- Metadata-only configured, active/inactive, current, checking, unavailable, and
  recovery-required status from one resolver.
- Persisted provider eligibility: configured providers default active; explicit
  deactivation survives restart and does not delete credentials.
- One renderer-independent authentication flow/controller contract with typed
  events, cancellation, stale-result rejection, and renderer adapters.
- Shared API-key, OpenAI account, and merged Claude subscription backends.
- Multi-provider onboarding with an explicit **Done** action.
- Deferred Corbanu Plan onboarding after provider selection, with success,
  cancel, return, and only-provider recovery behavior.
- `/providers` activation controls and replacement-before-deactivation for the
  current provider.
- Startup gating and current-model selection derived from the shared status and
  eligibility state rather than host-specific heuristics.
- Bounded operating-system keyring access for the encrypted provider vault so a
  locked or unresponsive credential service degrades through the existing
  fallback policy instead of freezing startup, save, read, or logout.
- One encrypted-store rewrite per logical vault mutation so provider add,
  rotation, and bulk removal do not repeatedly pay the age/scrypt cost while a
  save or logout is visibly pending.
- Optimized scrypt/Salsa primitives in development and test profiles, retaining
  the same pinned work factor and on-disk format while avoiding debug-only
  credential operations that exceed the harness timeout.
- Focused automated, snapshot, integration, adversarial redaction, substantial
  typed-TMUX, live-repository, human, documentation, and release evidence.
- PF-55-S03: reconcile Astra's native Codex model/tool/wire contract with the
  verified upstream release, repair compatibility negotiation, add regression
  and explicit opt-in live TUI harnesses, then install the verified candidate
  in the existing separate `corbanu-test` session using the user-approved normal
  profile. Test real Astra responses, tool execution, cancellation and resume.
- PF-55-S04: make authorized child runtime discovery and selection agree with
  the effective orchestration runtime, including V1 and unset model defaults;
  preserve operator allowlists and cross-provider plaintext adapters. Qualify
  Luna and Kimi K3 child results, failure/recovery and resume in disposable
  TensorCash and Isometric worktrees using the approved normal profile.
  The first live run exposed a second boundary defect: the exact-runtime
  plaintext adapter rejects OpenAI, whose reserved native schema cannot express
  model overrides. Support explicitly plaintext task briefs on that same-provider
  route without converting native ciphertext or widening provider authorization.
- PF-84 named accounts per provider: alternate API keys and subscription logins,
  chosen per session, worker or CLI, with per-account usage attribution.

### Out

- Changing provider wire protocols, pricing, subscriptions, or model catalogs,
  except preserving the user's explicitly requested incoming Ambient GLM-only
  change in PF-57-S03 and adding the explicitly requested OpenAI Astra manual
  selection in PF-55-S02 and the user-authorized Astra runtime upgrade in
  PF-55-S03. No unrelated default-model, pricing or automatic-allocation changes.
- Automatically importing, copying, or deleting provider-owned credentials.
- Interactive enrollment for a custom command-auth provider without a supported
  typed setup adapter; it remains visible with metadata/status and recovery copy.
- Making credential removal implicit in provider deactivation.
- Automatically switching the current model when a later provider is configured
  or when Corbanu Plan completes.
- Replacing the wallet, x402, or Corbanu Plan purchase implementation.
- Weakening vault, keyring, P0 credential-broker, or provider privacy controls.
- Releasing without a named human test or the repository release gates.

## Invariants

- Authentication state, provider eligibility, and the singular current
  model/provider selection are distinct typed concepts.
- Every successfully configured provider is active unless the user explicitly
  deactivates it; existing configured providers migrate to active by default.
- A provider is never marked configured merely because its catalog entry exists
  or its setup was queued.
- Raw credentials never enter model context, chat, rollout history, telemetry,
  logs, snapshots, TMUX artifacts, ordinary config, or status descriptions.
- Onboarding and `/providers` consume the same catalog and status service and
  dispatch the same typed auth-flow controller actions.
- Host renderers may differ, but authentication success, failure, cancellation,
  recovery, timeout, stale-result rejection, and persistence semantics may not.
- Environment-backed credentials are inspected only as metadata; removal UI
  cannot claim to delete an environment variable.
- Corbanu Plan is configured and active only after its deferred flow succeeds.
- Cancelling any flow is inert with respect to credentials, eligibility, current
  model, unrelated providers, and wallet/Plan state.
- Deactivating the current provider cannot silently select a replacement.
- A current usable provider/model is preserved. A fresh profile chooses the
  first successfully configured provider's default model.
- Unsupported or ambiguous auth sources fail visibly with recovery guidance;
  there is no heuristic account or billing-context fallback.
- An unresponsive operating-system credential service cannot block a provider
  operation indefinitely or start an unbounded number of stuck workers; the
  encrypted-vault fallback contract remains authoritative.
- No regular expression may inspect, route, transform, approve, repair, score,
  or gate any LLM prompt, model output, tool call, or provider response.

provider state, event routing or TUI host change is serial, integrated by the

implementation agent is not alone in the repository and must preserve unrelated
user work and integrate rather than revert concurrent changes.

## Upstream-touch record

| Field | Record |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline | Canonical upstream is `https://github.com/openai/codex.git`. Reverified from local `upstream/main` on 2026-09-01: upstream tip `ba6cf9c69277caec51a4c12c5b7401a9920930e0`, merge-base `413492cd6c3a4d4f8dff6f406247ccda5a9d88aa`; fork base for this initiative is `f7356a94e032234022a462d65b576a7de2854859`. Record the final candidate SHA at qualification. |
| Footprint | Product-owned provider-auth catalog/state/controller code, model-provider/config adapters, onboarding, `/providers`, app events/startup, tests, docs, and QA. Each sprint owns the literal subset in its record. |
| Boundary | Centralize Corbanu policy in a focused provider-auth module/crate. Keep upstream TUI, app-server login, config, and model-provider edits as thin typed adapters. TUI renderers never own raw storage or provider selection policy. |
| Compatibility | Preserve provider wire headers, account identity, credential stores, existing Claude source choice, app-server login cancellation, current model, config layering, startup, restart, resume, child-agent use, and native panes. |
| Verification | Contract and migration tests, affected crate suites, snapshots, config schema checks, redaction/canary checks, typed-TMUX flows, both default live repositories, physical platform evidence where required, and release records. |
| Upgrade handling | At final qualification, record upstream candidate, classify each adapter as retained/adapted/removed, resolve conflicts in a disposable worktree, and rerun combined-tree tests and TUI qualification. |

PF-57-S02 reverified the same local upstream baseline on 2026-09-04; it does not
merge an upstream update. Its fork base is `f03e95f7a65609bb442764d6306682d5fe43f6bb`.
Product-owned wallet IPC, Task Node persistence, and provider metadata adapters
retain existing authorization, wire formats, wallet assets, and session history.
Exact files, regression commands, candidate identity and platform limitations
are recorded in the sprint and `qa/release/0.1.38/astra-fixes.md`.

PF-55-S03 compares baseline `ba6cf9c69277caec51a4c12c5b7401a9920930e0` against
official `rust-v0.153.4`, commit `3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a`.
The native Astra catalog declares minimum client version `0.153.0`, Code Mode
tools, Responses Lite, unified execution and model-owned instructions. The
pre-repair fork advertised `0.144.1` and had an API-doc-derived Astra entry
that omitted these native harness requirements. The completed selective repair
shares the native minimum across discovery/inference and installs the native
model contract without replacing working Corbanu adapters. Account identity,
credential custody, non-OpenAI routes, permissions and history are preserved.
Both default repositories passed live Astra TUI file/tool, cancellation,
recovery and same-thread restart/resume with the installed binary. Exact source,
upstream disposition and evidence: [runtime qualification](../../../qa/release/0.1.38/astra-runtime.md).

PF-55-S04 retains that upstream baseline and the native V2 interfaces. The
product-owned adapter must distinguish a model's preferred orchestration version
from the engine version inherited by a child. No remote model metadata, reserved
OpenAI schema, provider authorization or credential format is rewritten.

PF-84 (named accounts, active 2026-10-10): S01 has no dependency;
S02 -> S03 -> S04, S03 + PF-60-S04 (accounting schema) -> S05, and S05 -> S06.
S01 and S02 run in parallel; the rest is serial.

Outside PF-84 one sprint is executable at a time. A dependent sprint remains draft until its
predecessor is completed and archived.

## Acceptance flows

| Flow | Starting state | User action | Expected visible result | Pass criterion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-provider success | Fresh profile | Configure two or more providers, return after each, then choose **Done** | All successful providers show configured and active; first successful provider supplies the initial model | Restart preserves eligibility and current model; each provider can make a real request |
| Deferred Corbanu success | At least one configured provider; Corbanu unconfigured | Queue Corbanu, configure another provider, choose **Done**, complete wallet/Plan flow | Provider screen returns immediately after queueing; Corbanu flow starts only after **Done** | Corbanu becomes configured/active and the existing current provider remains selected |
| Deferred Corbanu cancel | Corbanu queued | Escape or cancel deferred flow | No wallet, credential, eligibility, or current-model partial state | Continue with another usable provider; return to provider screen if none exists |
| Shared recovery | Missing, rejected, stale, or conflicting credential | Enter from either host, cancel/retry/replace through the same flow | Same status labels, actions, failure, and recovery semantics | No host-specific fallback or stale completion changes state |
| Deactivate non-current | Configured active provider not serving current model | Deactivate in `/providers` | Provider becomes inactive and credentials remain | Restart preserves inactive state; reactivation requires no reauthentication |
| Deactivate current | Current provider is active | Request deactivation | Replacement picker appears before mutation | Cancel is inert; choosing a usable replacement switches explicitly then deactivates |
| Custom API provider | Runtime custom provider declares `env_key` | Open either host and configure/use it | Provider appears automatically with shared status and masked setup | Both hosts and startup agree; raw key never appears |
| Existing install migration | Existing configured providers and usable selection | Upgrade and launch | Configured providers default active; current selection remains | No forced reauthentication or model switch |
| Existing single-account migration (PF-84) | Home with today's credentials | Upgrade and launch | Each provider shows one `default` account row | Same credentials resolve; vault unchanged until a named account is added |
| Add second account (PF-84) | One Claude Plan or API key configured | `/providers` → add account `work`, paste token or key | Two rows for that provider, one per account, no duplicates | Masked entry; restart preserves both |
| Session account switch (PF-84) | Two accounts | Choose "use for this session" on `work` | Status shows provider/`work` | Requests use `work`; default unchanged after restart |
| Worker on another account (PF-84) | Coordinator on `default` | Spawn subagent or tmux `corbanu exec --account work` | Spawn event shows `work` | Worker uses `work`, coordinator stays on `default`; failure never falls back |
| Account isolation (PF-84) | Fake-key account `bad` | Select `bad`, send a prompt | Visible 401 with recovery | No retry on another account; no value in any artifact |
| Per-account usage (PF-84) | Two accounts used | Open usage view | Rows grouped by provider and account | Counts match requests per account |
| Named AWS and ChatGPT accounts (PF-84-S06) | Bedrock or OpenAI sign-in configured | Add `aws-profile` account or sign in a second ChatGPT account | One row per account; fake or missing account visibly refused | Requests use that account's profile or tokens; refresh saves to that account; never falls back |
| Wrapper/home override (PF-84) | Inherited `CORBANU_HOME` | Launch through `~/.local/bin/corbanu` with another home | Warning or correct home | Never silently runs on the coordinator's home |

## Implementation sequence

1. Freeze provider identity, setup capability, catalog ordering, custom-provider,
   and host-presentation contracts in PF-48.
2. Centralize metadata-only status plus configured/eligibility persistence and
   migration in PF-49.
3. Build the renderer-independent typed controller and API-key adapter in PF-50.
4. Adapt OpenAI account login in PF-51 and the merged Claude flow in PF-52.
5. Replace onboarding's single-provider completion with the multi-provider and
   deferred Corbanu workflow in PF-53. Its shared host effect executor also maps
   OpenAI `ApiKeyStorage::OpenAiAuth` into the existing app-server API-key
   persistence request; PF-54 reuses that executor.
6. Rebuild `/providers` as a manager host with eligibility and safe replacement
   controls in PF-54.
7. Remove startup/catalog/status heuristics and converge custom-provider/current
   model behavior in PF-55.
8. Format, test, perform substantial true-TMUX qualification, run the bounded
   review program, document, and collect release evidence in PF-56.
9. Merge the latest `origin/main` without rewriting archived sprint commits,
   resolve shared-provider conflicts semantically, preserve post-fork fixes, and
   repair the combined suite's reproduced unbounded keyring wait before rerunning
   combined-tree qualification and independent review in PF-57.

## Review and TMUX policy

At most four formal review passes are planned across the initiative:

1. implementation-owner boundary/self-check after the shared contracts;
2. primary-agent integration review after both hosts are migrated;
3. primary-agent final-tree completeness/security review;
4. one external **Kimi 3.0 high through Vercel** review spawned and controlled
   through the TMUX harness against the final candidate. This is the user's
   explicit replacement for the attempted Claude Fable 5 review, which exited
   before model inference because its OAuth session could not be refreshed.

No additional autoreview or external review is scheduled. The accountable owner
may exceed four only when a review uncovers a major issue; the finding, reason,
remediation, and additional review must be recorded.

PF-57 is the recorded exception: integrating fourteen post-fork `main` commits
created two semantic Rust conflicts and review exposed provider-recovery edge
cases. The combined candidate was validated against `81dcbef5d`, reviewed with
Fable 5.1 Plan max through Corbanu and TMUX, and ended
`FINAL_REREVIEW: CLEAN`; see the [PF-57 record](../../qa/provider-auth/pf-57/fable-review.md).

TMUX proof is continuous, not deferred to a token final smoke. PF-53, PF-54, and
PF-55 add focused typed-TMUX scenarios; PF-56 reruns the full matrix on the
formatted integrated tree with real keys, visible checkpoints, cancellation,
recovery, restart/resume, and secret canaries.

## Live-repository applicability

PF-58 changes home-level authentication health and recovery, not project contents,
coding tasks or repository execution. Like PF-57-S02, neither default live
repository adds a distinct feature boundary here. Its final proof uses isolated
homes and loopback auth/model endpoints with real TMUX keys. This is a human-test
candidate, not release qualification; prior live-repository or benchmark results
are not claimed as rerun. The 2026-09-08 candidate incorporates main `3cec54d99`
through integration commit `472b8fed5`, preserving the security branch history.

| Repository | Applicable to this initiative? | Resolved checkout/test worktree | Base commit | Reason or result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TensorCash | yes | `/home/pfrpc/repos/worktrees/pf56-tensorcash-dd6e9202` | `dd6e92024254090de0f596b090bd5c74c4d97b90` | PASS: clean worktree; 586 native tests; two exact authorized Corbanu requests across process restart. |
| Isometric Game | yes | `/home/pfrpc/repos/worktrees/pf56-isometricgame-59821b7a` | `59821b7a85524f186f946c4670480c7ee96483cb` | PASS: clean worktree; both world checks and math; exact authorized Corbanu request plus same-thread resume. |

Disposable worktrees and exact base commits must be recorded before PF-56 runs.
Historical Claude artifacts do not substitute for final integrated-tree runs.

PF-57-S02 is a home-level credential-lifecycle repair, not a coding workflow or
release qualification. Neither TensorCash nor Isometric Game is applicable to
this bounded repair: the changed boundaries do not inspect project contents,
edit project files, or execute project tasks. Its proof uses isolated homes,
private daemon sockets and a loopback API with actual TUI input and restart.
The older PF-56 live-repository results above are historical, not reruns on the
2026-09-04 repair tree. Both live repositories, named-human acceptance and due
benchmarks remain release-level gates, not claims made by PF-57-S02.

PF-57-S03 follows the same bounded applicability: it preserves the incoming
home-level auth and catalog behavior without changing project-editing or coding
task execution. Its final Linux candidate passed 625 selected automated tests,
16 true-TMUX tests and manual `just codex` token-entry/cancel checks. The user's
Astra request received a bounded final combined-source review with no new
P0/P1 findings. None of these results replaces the release-level gates above;
see the [reconciliation evidence](../../../qa/release/0.1.38/travis-reconciliation.md).

| Deactivation | product | final product authority | PF-54 | `/providers`; preserve credential; require replacement before deactivating current |
| Review budget | delivery | Codex primary agent | PF-56 | four formal passes maximum unless a major finding is documented |
| External reviewer | delivery | Codex primary agent | PF-56 | User override on 2026-09-02: exactly one Kimi 3.0 high through Vercel, spawned and controlled via TMUX with no fallback; the earlier Fable OAuth failure remains superseded evidence |
| Upstream baseline/candidate | integration | Codex primary agent | PF-48/PF-56 | local `upstream/main` reverified at `ba6cf9c69277caec51a4c12c5b7401a9920930e0`; reverify final candidate at qualification |
| Live accounts and named human | release | release owner | PF-56/release | pending; cannot be fabricated |
| Physical Linux/Windows evidence | release | release owner | release | prior Claude plan left this unclosed; final applicability must be recorded |

| Latest-main integration | integration | Codex primary integration agent | PF-57 | Completed: preserved PF-48–PF-56 identities, merged latest-main baseline `81dcbef5d`, and qualified candidate `a935e507b`. |
| Credential-store liveness | regression | Codex primary integration agent | PF-57 | Completed: bounded serialized keyring operations, late-success circuit recovery, batched logical vault mutations including managed Claude token enrollment, and development/test-only crypto optimization preserve encrypted-vault fallback, work factor, format, and production implementation. |
| Review remediation | regression | Codex primary integration agent | PF-57 | Completed: fresh onboarding occurs only when the current provider is unconfigured and no ready configured interactive alternative exists; established inactive, unavailable, recovery-required, removed, or missing-current profiles enter chat blocked until explicit recovery. Onboarding caches status, compatible-model persistence precedes selection completion, local/status-only providers remain usable, and command auth stays lazy. Dead legacy UI cleanup remains nonblocking follow-up work. |
| D1 PF-84 storage | product | Travis | PF-84-S02 | **Recommended default adopted 2026-10-10; Travis may revisit.** one vault per home with account-qualified labels (no new keychain items). Alternative: a home per account (proven, but splits vault, sessions and usage). |
| D2 PF-84 import | product | Travis | PF-84-S04 | **Recommended default adopted 2026-10-10; Travis may revisit.** no automatic import from per-home workaround homes; re-enroll. |
| D3 PF-84 model-chosen account | security | Travis | PF-84-S03 | **Recommended default adopted 2026-10-10.** spawn `account` limited to configured names, shown in the spawn event; requires approval under `/security` Aggressive, refused with approvals off. **#428 decided 2026-10-11 by Travis (option 1):** "Aggressive" also covers every state the TUI shows as Aggressive while Core's level stays lower ("Aggressive enforced, boundary unverified", "Active in this session: Aggressive"). Implemented by #432 (refused with approvals off). |
| D4 PF-84 ChatGPT and AWS accounts | product | Travis | PF-84-S06 | **Decided 2026-10-11 by Travis (option (a))**: new S06 after S05, AWS profile accounts first, then ChatGPT/OpenAI sign-in accounts. Open points listed in the S06 record. |
| PF-76-S01 overlap | integration | plan owner | PF-84-S02 | Reconciled 2026-10-10: PF-76 stores a profile's sign-in as a PF-84 named account selected by `[profiles.<name>.provider_accounts]`; see the PF-84 section. |

## Release linkage

- Release record: `qa/release/<version>/` — target version pending.
- Benchmark tracker row: `benchmarks/README.md` when due.
- Remaining gates from the earlier Claude plan: live eligible production-account
  evidence, named human acceptance, physical Linux/Windows confirmation where
  applicable, target release/tag and release-ledger decisions, upstream
  disposition, and due benchmark evidence.
- PF-48–PF-57 implementation, combined-tree TMUX qualification, and independent
  review are complete; they are no longer release blockers.

## Completion

- [x] Product linkage, P1 priority, scope, invariants, ownership, and worktree are current.
- [x] Merged PF-42–PF-47 Claude evidence is preserved without claiming open gates.
- [x] Every new implementation unit has one stable feature ID and one sprint record.
- [x] PF-48 through PF-57 are completed and archived; final code candidate is `a935e507b`.
- [x] Required final-tree automated and adversarial evidence passes.
- [x] Required true-TUI and both live-repository workflows pass.
- [ ] Named human acceptance passes.
- [x] Finished documentation matches the accepted candidate.
- [ ] Upstream disposition, release record, and due benchmark state are linked.
- [ ] No hard release gate remains pending.
