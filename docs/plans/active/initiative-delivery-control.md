# 3. Task Node integration and delivery control

## Current authority — September 13 management bootstrap

Travis explicitly authorized all five bootstrap deliverables in
[coordinatorInstructions.md](../../../coordinatorInstructions.md). Execute the
[bounded bootstrap allocation](../../research/tasknode-integration/coordinator-bootstrap-20260913.md)
within PF-80-S01. Security/accounting product implementation and old recurring
automations remain paused. Parent coordinates bootstrap until the fresh Fable
launcher and decision path are qualified; this is an explicit startup exception,
not a claim the new management runtime already exists. The stale progress and
allocations below are historical; no other owner should resume from them.

September13 scope amendment: Travis removed the private off-Mac dashboard-access
requirement. Tailscale administrator setup is no longer active work or a bootstrap
launch gate; existing SSH publication and private loopback serving remain. Other
Slack, independent functional and unattended-recovery gates are unchanged.

September13 02:27UTC: Slack credential/identity/Socket connection preflight is
complete; no human credential hold remains. Durable alert/reply/phone/native ACK
and independent isolated qualification remain manager-owned. James returned
927/424 uncompiled owned-ingress source; scoped formatting is now authorized
under the same ten paths, target1800/1000 STOP1950/1100. Dependency/build handoff
is serialized behind accounting's active Mac gate; no user decision or new route.

Historical September13: Slack installation/access are complete; then-pending
private credential-file handoff and actual live qualification remained. Earlier
permission holds below are superseded. Corrected646-line isolation engineering
and12tests accepted; not a confined reasoning executor. James now owns the
[ten-file bounded synthetic ingress implementation](../../research/tasknode-integration/owned-ingress-allocation-20260913.md)
in tasknode-owned-ingress-20260913. Source authoring starts now; parent serializes
dependency/lock/build integration after accounting's current Mac correction.
No worker waits on a human allocation decision; live alerts/posting stay OFF.

23:16UTC: [actual Slack access question](../../../qa/initiative-control/status-display/slack-access-decision.md)
is awaiting Travis's action-time confirmation; SocketMode ON but webhook-only
bot scopes/events OFF. Only live setup held, not ongoing offline work. Isolated
engineering returned588lines/11actualRTXpasses and first independent boundary
review is running. Real confined executor/phone/nativeACK still unqualified;
the earlier testing-only status understated the actual app-configuration gap.

22:44UTC: [rootless isolation engineering](../../../qa/initiative-control/status-display/isolated-boundary-engineering-20260912.md)
is allocated to James: exactly five private runner files,525target/650hard,
actual RTX seccomp/cgroup/cleanup/PTY probes, one boundary review plus necessary
correction. Feasibility inspection is complete; engineering is now dispatched.
No VM-equivalence, actual confined reasoning executor, live Slack or phone/ACK
acceptance is claimed. Those next gates are manager-owned, not user questions.

22:03UTC: supervisor review08 clean; exact5-file c7a1b9690 received92d6eb261.
All261 combined tests pass187.549s; Facilities/governance pass, original failures
retained. [Integration and next owner](../../../qa/initiative-control/status-display/slack-supervisor-integration-20260912.md).
James now verifies existing isolated-execution proposal against actual available
machine/tools, private evidence only; manager owns final infrastructure allocation
and actual Slack/phone/nativeACK qualification. Live remains OFF, no user decision.

20:57UTC manager handoff: recovery review07 clean, receiving251 tests pass
144.128s at a89a48548. [Real owned-listener supervision](../../research/tasknode-integration/slack-supervised-quiescence-allocation.md)
is the current exact five-file sequential James assignment in the new supervisor
checkout above. Older allocations below are history, not concurrent mandates.
Manager accepts the bounded guard-born/legacy-unknown contract and850/400 hard
ceiling; new reviews08/09 preserve01–07. Actual live Slack/phone/native ACK and
independent isolated execution remain required before operator-ready acceptance.

September12 next: gated transport/shared registration accepted atb9e671e60.
The [local fence-loss recovery allocation](../../research/tasknode-integration/slack-fence-recovery-allocation.md)
owns five paths in the fresh second worktree above, one sequential James worker.
Old worker checkout is frozen, not concurrently active. Manager approved
loss-record retention and historical alert-revision refusal, not new authority.
Supervisor/quiescence wiring is now integrated above; live/phone/ACK remain unqualified.

18:41: combined review06 clean,244 staging tests and Facilities/governance pass
on3561ebcc2. Manager imported13 exact code/receipt/guidance files into receiving,
preserving current allocation records. Receiving final suite is in progress;
missing-fence recovery and actual Slack/phone/ACK qualification still prevent
live enablement. No seventh opinion on unchanged clean code; proceed to actual
remaining evidence and supported recovery. Earlier statuses remain history.

18:14 review05 found a same-owner initial-qualification retry deadlock after
transient auth failure. Manager authorizes its narrow correction and recovery
regressions under the [allocation](../../research/tasknode-integration/slack-live-allocation.md):
same seven paths, worker2700/1140, parent650/500, combined3350/1640, one necessary
changed-candidate review06. No erased journals, expanded recovery architecture
or live authority; preserve234 passing tests and all earlier review history.

17:22 manager classification: the [allocation](../../research/tasknode-integration/slack-live-allocation.md)
now authorizes the narrow lifetime-lock/session-lease correction only, same
seven worker paths. Worker2600/1100, combined3250/1600 and one changed-candidate
review preserve prior usage. Broader quarantine/recovery-send/migration proposals
are excluded; missing-fence bookkeeping recovery remains a separate pre-live
manager action. Canonical publication17:15:52 is verified; this later amendment
awaits the next scheduled sync, not a second publication in this heartbeat.

Latest17:12UTC: third Slack recovery candidate2116/840 has225 passing tests.
Review04 found an abrupt-listener-exit gap; source freezes for exact session/fence
recovery contract classification by manager, with James preparing the proposal.
The missing-fence recovery limitation is included, not silently reset. Prior
review03 and its two-cycle convergence classification remain in the allocation.
Manager shared registration is actual uncommitted code in the separately declared
staging checkout, with passing local ingress/two-question/revision proof; not
accepted, published or live. No new human approval requested for manager work.

Latest16:13UTC: real SDK first correction returned1688total/768non-test with208
passing Python tests. Review02 found three remaining integration defects: stale
permit after an ACK notice, silent SDK disconnect, and pending events before
resolution. Manager inspected the code and pinned SDK, then dispatched one
coherent second correction to James. Prior reviews and198-test failures remain.
Manager owns shared CLI/status registration and actual Slack/phone/native-ACK
qualification; these are executable manager tasks, not missing human approval.
Live Slack and Task Node posting remain OFF; S01/beta readiness not claimed.

Latest14:50UTC: offline recovery730577f1d integrated9877c058d after clean
corrective review04 and169 receiving Python tests plus Facilities/governance.
Manager accepts1506total/638non-test; original targets and all three failed
reviews remain in the receipt. [Real Slack allocation](../../research/tasknode-integration/slack-live-allocation.md)
owns the sequential seven-file worker plus ten manager-owned paths,1800/1000
target and1900/1050 reallocation boundary. Native-subagent bridge, real SDK,
registration and qualified connection/HTTPS/phone/ACK evidence are next.
No new recipient decision, live activation or full sprint acceptance is inferred.

Current September12: F01 age1a6d9c8df reviewed/integrated;122Python/Facilities Node pass. Laplace returned exact-package browser proof: age and legal-ID history regression pass;152 no-exposure trials, DEC021mixed-feed useful-content expectation still partial. Darwin independently checks the packet; no new human-readiness claim. Earlier code/design/evidence usage and corrected P2 remain recorded. [Slack recovery allocation](../../research/tasknode-integration/slack-recovery-allocation.md) now owns five new files, target1200total/650non-test with explicit coherent-unit exception, one new-code review plus necessary correction. Manager reviews/integrates allocation before Astra High dispatch; real Slack/Task Node stay OFF. UI evidence does not block this independent offline successor.

## Activation record

September12 overnight authority: Travis authorizes routine redacted progress to
existing mapped Task Node tasks once technology is ready, and prioritizes Slack.
No per-progress approval is needed after actual validity/enrollment/target,
redaction, idempotency and recovery qualification. Keep posting OFF until then;
the integrator owns bounded enablement and first-delivery verification. No task
acceptance, rewards, financial/signing action, public beta or new recipient is
authorized. Supported credential setup/channel verification remain necessary;
never scrape session tokens or distribute wallet seeds. This supersedes older
requests for another approval for ordinary mapped progress only.

Slot 3/3. Reuse native `/tasknode` and Campaign Tracker, not another auth system
or scheduler. The [main handoff](../main-workstreams-2026-09-11.md) owns source
and ID migration. Existing Linux dashboard operation is preserved separately.

## User pain

Parallel agent output exceeds Travis's one-hour daily review budget.

## Product intent and ideal flow

Open the
private overview, identify the next decision and inspect exact candidate evidence,
blockers, machine/run reports and human test plans. Workers cannot self-accept.

## Product linkage

**Internal delivery control — TO BUILD**, “Use sequential sprints per initiative”.
## Scope

PF-80 owns the internal projection/progress adapter; PF-79 owns the subsequent
public Desktop beta program. PF-81 owns the queued standalone visual QA harness,
as requested by Travis through the PF13/provider-reauth owner on September 11.
No fourth initiative, automatic main merge/push, release,
reward, financial action or private-recording export is authorized.

Local receiving-branch integration and reallocation within PF-80 are now
manager-owned under the [continuation rule](../../sprints/index.md#manager-owned-continuation).
The [current handoff](../workstream-manager-handoff-2026-09-11.md) records
combined-tree evidence and the next offline native slice; live authority is separate.

Native preparation candidate `2b281975a` is now independently reviewed and
integrated locally at `c33d47f6c`: 42 native tests, 54 Python tests and two
cross-language goldens pass on the receiving tree. The manager is preparing
the next profile-bound one-event increment; no sender or production entry exists
in the accepted preparation slice. Whole PF-80-S01 remains in progress.
The bound engine 7e25982b5 is now reviewed/integrated at 486d2fb94, with all55
Task Node tests passing. Native adapter d7bf73a52 is now reviewed/integrated
at56295f668; all63 crate tests pass there. It builds actual Client requests
in memory and consumes pinned response fixtures; no sending or live authority.
Exact-goal reconciliation177ec93fc is also reviewed/integrated at3898eaa65;
all73 native tests pass there. Travis approved both setup/validity directions;
PF-80-S01 is in manager-owned allocation preparation, not waiting on those answers.
The [native-validity allocation](../../research/tasknode-integration/native-validity-allocation.md)
owns the now-reviewed production-compiled private path bda5b35b4. Combined staging
04ba6b8b7 passes242state/80TaskNode tests; no public caller enabled. See
[staging evidence](../../../qa/initiative-control/native-staging-2026-09-12.md).
The [dashboard decision/Slack amendment](../decision-escalation.md) is queued within
PF-80-S01. Channel setup and publication qualification are separate from this code.
The [prepared projection allocation](../../research/tasknode-integration/decision-projection-next.md)
is historical. [Slack recovery allocation](../../research/tasknode-integration/slack-recovery-allocation.md) records current five-file ownership and tests; the manager receipt records actual dispatch, not plan prose.
The [runtime recovery handoff](../../research/tasknode-integration/recovery-decision-handoff.md)
records manager design work, recommendations and the gated human test plan.

PF-80 replaces only the recovery operations source's conflicting PF-76 identity.
Main's provider-persistence PF-76 and security PF-77/PF-78 remain untouched.
Historical QA and durable outbox IDs keep their original identity. Never silently
remap old events or replay them as new work; migrate only after reconciliation.

## Existing evidence versus main deliverable

Native account linking and three Proposed personal task targets were verified
in installed Corbanu 0.1.36. [Task receipts](../tasknode-workstream-tasks-2026-09-11.md)
and [setup checks](../../../qa/initiative-control/2026-09-11/tasknode-setup.md)
do not establish accepted tasks, current worker profile isolation or live posting.
The private dashboard, tested adapter and default-OFF checker exist on the
recovery source, not this main baseline. PF-80-S01 must port the bounded tooling,
qualify it here and prepare a reviewed first-event path. The port and corrections
are now integrated locally at the receiving base recorded above; remote main and
the current publisher remain distinct. September12 cutover already selected
the manager receiving checkout; obsolete publishers were archived and normal native Luna publication recovered, most recently d19e34b16 at12:37:35Z. No user click remains. Do not copy the whole
recovery branch or any auth/session/state directory.

## Invariants

One manager owns shared plans, allocation and dashboard configuration. A worker
owns only its assigned implementation/research/QA paths and per-run report.
## Ownership and implementation worktrees

The first checkout above is the manager, the second the Astra High Task Node
worker. The third is a verified **draft-only** PF-81 destination, not a running
allocation or provider-auth reactivation. Reconcile its then-current HEAD and
pending work before promotion; [handoff](../visual-test-harness-allocation-2026-09-11.md).
Fast-forward the Task Node worker to the merged planning commit before dispatch;
record actual HEAD in the kickoff receipt. No raw HTML, remote images, credentials or private logs in
the projection. Unknown/stale evidence stays visible. OFF hides discovery and
denies new work while preserving data and supported recovery.

## Useful code references

Reuse `codex-rs/cli/src/tasknode_cmd.rs`, native tasknode-session/profile and
Campaign Tracker contracts read-only initially. Port `scripts/initiative_control/`
from the inspected recovery source under an audited manifest; tests must run on
the receiving main tree. Keep `docs/plans/check.py` and `docs/sprints/check.py`
manager-owned. The original kickoff was Python-only. The current PF-80-S01
test-only reconciliation child is accepted and frozen. New validity allocation
allows private async Client byte extraction and an unexposed identity observer;
no production entry, live call, auth store, queue or dependency changes.
See the [accepted allocation](../../research/tasknode-integration/native-reconciliation-allocation.md)
and runtime recovery handoff above before a new allocation.
[Feature delivery contract](../feature-delivery.md).

## Sprint execution map

| Feature | Sprint | State and acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PF-80 | [S01 native delivery-control integration](../../sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-80-s01-delivery-control.md) | Native validity reviewed/tested in staging; next contextual decision allocation in preparation; Slack and live acceptance still pending |
| PF-79 | [S01 Desktop beta channel/test contract](../../sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-79-s01-beta-channel-and-test-contract.md) | Draft; depends on PF-80-S01; Desktop source/permissions unresolved |
| PF-79 | [S02 public beta pilot](../../sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-79-s02-public-beta-pilot.md) | Draft; depends on S01; no public launch |
| PF-81 | [S01 bounded screenshot/inference QA harness](../../sprints/current/initiative-delivery-control/pf-81-s01-visual-test-harness.md) | Draft; depends on PF-80-S01; existing PF13 task owns later implementation, no new worker |

## Acceptance flows

Success: inspect a real plan, candidate and next human decision. Failure: invalid
reports or publication preserve last-good state. Recovery: restart and relink
through supported controls, retaining IDs and visible blockers.

## Implementation sequence

First audit/port the bounded internal tooling and pinned native progress
contract, then test report/queue/publication recovery, then prepare human-approved
first delivery. Reconcile every queued event before enabling anything; an
enrolled bulk flush is not a safe one-event qualification. Keep posting OFF
until the operator authorizes the account/destination/scope and exact payload.
Beta follows the [detailed contract](../tasknode-beta-program.md): isolated exact
Desktop candidate, public safe cards, independent testing and a bounded pilot.
PF-81 is another sequential follow-up, not parallel with PF-80 or beta. Its order
number does not override dependencies or reserve priority over existing beta
drafts. The manager chooses one eligible sprint at promotion. Only fixture-driven
QA and endpoint setup instructions are allocated; live control, deployment and
inference qualification stay gated by explicit target and data permission.

## Independent functional execution — September 12

The next applicable user-facing handoff follows the mandatory
[isolated execution gate](../../../qa/code-blind-functional/isolated-execution.md).
The named integrator owns packet/isolation provisioning and separate executor
and reviewer assignments; implementation owners do not execute acceptance cases.
Record increment-specific internal-only N/A with later functional gate, not a
plan-wide exemption. Missing isolation is manager work, not unanswered approval.
Existing evidence stays historical; dependencies, feature flags and live authority
are unchanged. See the linked rollout table for this lane's next acceptance.

## Automated evidence

Focused Python/governance suites, negative HTTP fixtures, retained last-good
publication and source-provenance checks must pass on the receiving tree.
PF-81 additionally requires deterministic malformed-action, stale-frame,
out-of-bounds, budget/cancel and replay tests. Model conclusions remain evidence
for human review, not self-acceptance; preserve blocked/native-not-run outcomes.

## True-TUI evidence

Native
interactive changes require actual-key true-TUI proof; document-only evidence
does not qualify them.

## Human acceptance

Named human acceptance, entitlement, supported proposed-
target lifecycle and remote credential permission remain pending. Do not import
seeds or distribute the linked broad human session to workers.

## Live-repository applicability

TensorCash/Isometric are not applicable to the internal document projection;
runtime and release journeys retain the root applicability/qualification rules.
## Documentation

Unfinished contracts remain
plans/research/QA; finished product documentation waits for qualification.

## Dependencies, decisions, and blockers

Port/runtime review, supported public/credential authority and human acceptance
remain gates. No live post, beta launch or reward decision is authorized here.

## Release linkage

No release or benchmark completion is asserted. Root release policy is unchanged.

## Completion

- [x] Exact independent worker coordinates, literal write scope and combined-tree gate recorded; dispatch follows main merge.
- [ ] Main port and focused tests/review complete; existing source evidence not relabeled as a new pass.
- [ ] Human accepts dashboard/recovery, target lifecycle, entitlement and exact first delivery; posting remains OFF until then.
- [ ] Desktop repository/channel owner, public board scope, evidence destination, cohort and reward policy resolved before beta readiness.
- [ ] Sequential sprint evidence and required human/release linkage complete before archive or shipping claims.
