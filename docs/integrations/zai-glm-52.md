# Z.AI GLM 5.2 Integration

Corbanu Terminal also supports direct GLM access through Z.AI's pay-as-you-go API, billed per token.

The built-in `zai` provider uses the general API endpoint, not the GLM Coding Plan
endpoint (`/api/coding/paas/v4`). A Coding Plan subscriber can point a custom provider at
that endpoint; `/cost` then records tokens without a price, because the bundled rates are
the per-token API rates.

## Current Provider

The built-in Z.AI provider is defined in `codex-rs/model-provider-info/src/lib.rs`:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Provider id | `zai` |
| Display name | `Z.AI` |
| Base URL | `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4` |
| API key env var | `ZAI_API_KEY` |
| Wire API | `chat` |
| OpenAI auth required | `false` |
| WebSockets | `false` |

Auth guidance shown to users:

```text
Set ZAI_API_KEY to your Z.AI API key.
```

## Current Model

The visible Z.AI model is bundled in `codex-rs/models-manager/models.json`:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Slug | `glm-5.2` |
| Display name | `Z.AI GLM 5.2` |
| Description | `GLM 5.2 through the Z.AI API, billed per token.` |
| Context window | `1000000` tokens |
| Default reasoning level | `medium` |
| Listed in picker | yes |
| Parallel tool calls | yes |

## Model And Provider Selection

Corbanu Terminal maps model selections to providers in `codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/model_popups.rs`:

- `glm-*` and `glm-5.2` resolve to provider `zai` (OpenAI-style) by default.
- The same GLM models are also served by `zai-anthropic`, Z.AI's Anthropic-compatible
  connection (the GLM Coding Plan route) with the same `ZAI_API_KEY`. `/model` lists both
  connections in the Z.AI tab, e.g. **GLM 5.3 Flash · Z.AI (OpenAI-style)** and
  **GLM 5.3 Flash · Z.AI (Claude-style)**; see
  [Choosing the connection](../features/model-providers.md#choosing-the-connection).
- `zai-org/*` resolves to provider `ambient`.
- The all-models popup only shows Corbanu Terminal-relevant Ambient and Z.AI models by default.

Configuration normalization in `codex-rs/core/src/config/mod.rs` keeps Z.AI sessions on Z.AI-compatible models:

- If `model_provider = "zai"` and no compatible model is configured, Corbanu Terminal selects `glm-5.2`.
- If a configured Z.AI model does not start with `glm-`, Corbanu Terminal replaces it with `glm-5.2`.
- Z.AI reasoning effort is normalized to the GLM `Standard`/`Deep` behavior.

## Request Behavior

Z.AI shares the GLM request compatibility path with Ambient:

- Corbanu Terminal emits `enable_thinking=true`.
- Corbanu Terminal emits `emit_usage=true`.
- Corbanu Terminal sends `reasoning_effort=high` for Standard mode.
- Corbanu Terminal sends `reasoning_effort=max` for Deep mode.
- Function-tool schemas omit the OpenAI `strict` wrapper bit because GLM chat streams tool calls correctly without it.

Z.AI has one extra guard in the Chat Completions path: when native `web_search` and function tools would be mixed, Corbanu Terminal preserves client-executed function tools and removes native `web_search`, because coding sessions need shell/file tools to continue.

## Onboarding

The onboarding flow can present Z.AI as a provider API-key account alongside Ambient. This is tested in `codex-rs/tui/src/onboarding/auth.rs`.

Z.AI keys saved through onboarding are stored in the encrypted vault at:

```text
provider/zai_api_key
```

The environment variable `ZAI_API_KEY` is still supported for temporary shells
and automation. Corbanu reads it to call Z.AI but removes it from the commands
the model runs, so a command (or a prompt injection) can't read your key. To
give it to commands on purpose, see
[Shell Environment](../config.md#shell-environment).
