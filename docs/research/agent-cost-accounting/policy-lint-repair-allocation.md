# PF-60-S02 — receiving policy-lint repair

## 21:48 heartbeat — external normal-library test correction

First seven-file candidate returned193total/101non-test,575 full and105 focused
tests pass, normal check passes. Scoped Clippy101 now exposes eight errors in
codex-rs/state/tests/accounting_store.rs: direct connect_with plus seven unwraps.
Manager read the full external test and literal diagnostics. Add ONLY that eighth
path to this same correction; same worker/branch/base, target300/150 STOP450/225,
no review spent yet. Original frozen candidate/logs remain preserved.

Use the existing PUBLIC SqliteConfig::open_read_write_pool and an owned acquired
connection, explicitly releasing/closing the pool/connection before reopen.
Keep required write-capable schema-fault tests, foreign keys, original native
owner IDs/time/amounts, all assertions and normal-library linkage. No private
implementation include, cfg(test) dependency, new production helper/API or lint
allowance. Replace fallible fixture unwraps with Result/context propagation and
call-site ?, not alternate/default values. Existing fixture databases are
disposable; this does not change production SQLite options. Verify any changed
fixture connection semantics and close/reopen behavior with the full target.

Then fmt, all four external cases and full575 state/API/TaskNode gate, scoped
six-crate existing-policy Clippy and normal check. Preserve first101 and575/105
receipts, no baseline waiver. First independent code review remains unspent;
freeze the whole corrected eight-file candidate before parent dispatch. Any
new path, public API or ceiling overrun returns to manager before edits.

Manager allocation, September12. Bounded corrective unit within active PF-60,
specification **Product measurement**, “No commercial performance numbers have
been supplied.” Restore existing lint policy without changing accounting,
retention, request identity or database fault semantics; collection remains OFF.

## Baseline and ownership

Reviewed Anthropic24-file candidatebc9b8b0d8 is integrated. Combined receiving
71focused and840shared tests pass, normal six-library check passes. Full-Core
historical failures remain unwaived. Existing-policy scoped Clippy exited101:
accounting expect/redundant closures/direct SQLite pools/needless borrow and API
telemetry two redundant closures/UUID-header expect. The telemetry lines are
preexisting401ddcc206/c6b48e6b36, not caused by Anthropic, but are now explicitly
allocated for small behavior-preserving repair. Strict -D warnings protocol
large_enum_variant remains separate unchanged history, not silently suppressed.

Mendel, existing native Astra High worker, moves sequentially to
`/Volumes/CorbanuDrive/Corbanu/worktrees/accounting-policy-repair-20260912`, branch
`workstream/accounting-policy-repair-20260912`, base
`a89a48548f644a64cbb8cd9da090b5b75578c922`. Original accounting checkout is frozen
history. Manager grants exclusive edits to these seven paths; no other active
worker owns state/sqlite or API telemetry. Cargo/lock and security are read-only.

independent Astra High code review plus one necessary correction authorized;
prior Anthropic01–03 and all failures remain. Manager owns review dispatch and
receiving integration; worker returns a frozen uncommitted candidate first.

## Exact repair and proof

Replace embedded CREATE-name panic with a typed/contextual error, preserving
schema rejection. Use direct method references and remove the needless borrow.
Route fixture pools through the state SQLite shim. A narrow cfg(test) helper
inside sqlite.rs may accept exact SqlitePoolOptions/SqliteConnectOptions to
preserve before_acquire barriers, one connection, zero busy timeout, paths and
existing separate-store fault behavior. Do not replace these with generic
five-connection/default-timeout pools, remove concurrency assertions, add public
production API or blanket lint allowances. Ordinary production shim unchanged.

Telemetry must retain exact released-request correlation and request-ID rotation,
including poisoned-lock handling. Eliminate the expect without substituting an
empty ID, swallowing a failure as success, or changing retries. Existing tests
remain intact; extend same-file tests where needed. No pricing/catalog/provider,
public deletion/schema/migration, late-import, live collection or new feature.

Use pinned1.95/offline, approved build recipes, exclusive target and no cache
cleanup/lock changes. Run fmt before final tests; existing-policy scoped Clippy
for six affected crates with --locked --no-deps, no extra global -D warnings or
lint suppression. Retain original failing log. Newly exposed findings outside
seven paths require manager classification, not broad repair or a false pass.
Run complete state/API/TaskNode tests and affected telemetry/retention/native
cases, normal-library check and both governance checkers. Manager reruns affected
combined gates; 71+840 accepted evidence is not a replacement for changed tests.

Increment-specific independent functional execution N/A: this is an internal
behavior-preserving lint correction, with no user-facing handoff. Later PF60
interactive/caller acceptance remains subject to policy1.7; historical tests
are not upgraded. S02 remains in_progress; S03 stays draft. The next actual
feature unit is bounded90..365-day compact-only import, already proposed privately,
not a reason to withhold these concrete fixes or ask Travis another question.
