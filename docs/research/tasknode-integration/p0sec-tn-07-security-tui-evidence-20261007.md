# Task Node evidence record: P0SEC-TN-07

Compile the P0SEC-TN-07 Security TUI Lane Evidence Record. Task `task_627354898804e21841f81a559fe63462`, request `req_36bf02981ba06ce3ab13933094e79f0c326ee0aa673ec759713634c5e716e776`. Every PR below is merged to `main` in
CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal. Each merge commit was checked with `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/main`
at `bb609b449a` (2026-10-07). The quoted blocks are copied verbatim from the sprint and gate records (links
re-pointed to this file's location).

Per-sprint gate (Travis, 2026-10-06): focused `just test`, a GLM 5.2 tmux run, one independent Opus 5.5 High
review and SOP demo videos, then merge behind the feature flag. **Not claimed:** the milestone code-blind VM run,
human sign-off, flag removal and the P1 hardening plan. Carried-forward items are recorded as open, not done.
