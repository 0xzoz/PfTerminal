# Task Node evidence record: P0SEC-TN-04

Compile the P0SEC-TN-04 Protected-Mode Sprint Evidence Record. Task `task_8ce36190b7954b6d5d4f1bcd691886cc`, request `req_8d71397c5c9650ec18a81ecd6c45a4be8ef6d230a1ff1065fd848e2529757f86`. Every PR below is merged to `main` in
CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal. Each merge commit was checked with `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/main`
at `bb609b449a` (2026-10-07). The quoted blocks are copied verbatim from the sprint and gate records (links
re-pointed to this file's location).

Per-sprint gate (Travis, 2026-10-06): focused `just test`, a GLM 5.2 tmux run, one independent Opus 5.5 High
review and SOP demo videos, then merge behind the feature flag. **Not claimed:** the milestone code-blind VM run,
human sign-off, flag removal and the P1 hardening plan. Carried-forward items are recorded as open, not done.
