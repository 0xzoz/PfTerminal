# Task Node evidence record: P0SEC-TN-08

Compile the P0SEC-TN-08 Security Levels Convergence Evidence Record. Task `task_4c84685243b6fd68facf8c2667fbaa15`, request `req_eff6fbe134688692e4b24b2eb5d94cf1872c7421411406e337ada6eb747ade1a`. Every PR below is merged to `main` in
CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal. Each merge commit was checked with `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/main`
at `bb609b449a` (2026-10-07). The quoted blocks are copied verbatim from the sprint and gate records (links
re-pointed to this file's location).

Per-sprint gate (Travis, 2026-10-06): focused `just test`, a GLM 5.2 tmux run, one independent Opus 5.5 High
review and SOP demo videos, then merge behind the feature flag. **Not claimed:** the milestone code-blind VM run,
human sign-off, flag removal and the P1 hardening plan. Carried-forward items are recorded as open, not done.

## PF-41-S01: Effective security inspector and degradation state

Summary: tests `pf_41_s01` core 6/6, tui 14/14; security filters core 324/324, TUI 286/287, app-server-client 37/38 (TMPDIR-length failures); Linux clippy on the RTX box. TUI run: GLM 5.2 tmux run (inspect, inject failure, Blocked, confirm, restart, recovered). Review: Opus 5.5 High: round 2 APPROVE WITH FIXES, fixes applied.

Gate record: [qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-41-S01/README.md](../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-41-S01/README.md).

## PF-13-S07: Integrated credential boundary qualification + saved-level matrix

Summary: tests canary harness: 9 probes, 0 canary leaks on macOS and Linux (the Linux run used the earlier candidate e72563e5f7; rerun on the current candidate is an open item). Saved-level route matrix (saved Aggressive and Moderate, macOS and Linux): 0 leaked, 1 not contained (mcp_hook, by design), 1 known gap (claude_pane) on all four runs; each result file `route-matrix-v5-{aggressive,moderate}-{macos,linux}.json` holds 13 route rows and the summary `{"total": 13, "blocked": 11, "leaked": 0, "not_contained": 1, "known_gap": 1}`, so the correct count is 11 BLOCKED per run (routes 2 `files_arbitrary` and 2b `files_credential_path` are separate checks). The sprint record and PR #255 say "10 blocked", which undercounts (10 + 1 + 1 does not reach 13); this record uses 11. Route-matrix BLOCKED is model-mediated. Deterministic direct probes: `$HOME/.ssh` DENIED by the sandbox on 3 of 4 v1 runs (Linux Moderate: model refused), Corbanu home DENIED on all 4 reruns, an arbitrary non-credential file stays readable by design, `.aws` untested end to end (unit test only). TUI run: route matrix and direct probes through the agent. Review: independent Opus 5.5 High reviews; round 5 CHANGES REQUIRED, all six findings addressed in the evidence (no later re-review verdict recorded).

Verbatim, sprint record `docs/sprints/current/p0-security-levels/pf-13-s07-integrated-credential-boundary-qualification.md`, Verification:

> - [x] Fix/format owning crates before freezing the candidate; run final affected policy, Vault, proxy and Core suites without filtering failures.
> - [x] Run the canary harness on all promised platforms with candidate/source identity and complete-output scans.
> - [ ] Full isolated code-blind VM run (milestone only).
> - [x] TUI applicability: component-only here; PF-26-S02 retains the integrated true-TUI and live-repository workflows.

RTX box was inaccessible via SSH for a re-run on the new candidate. These TUI security files are launch-boundary adjacent but the canary harness tests the credential boundary (broker, vault, proxy, policy), not the TUI launch path. |
