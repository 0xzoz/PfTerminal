# Task Node evidence record: P0SEC-TN-03

Compile the P0SEC-TN-03 Egress Destination Policy Evidence Record. Task `task_94f31f7ebd6ba20445da0291ca77f945`, request `req_6ab71c71b9e9eaf14e8909d191cdb28ce2a0a6bf7bd2bdad2ea9e09fdc3ef4d6`. Every PR below is merged to `main` in
CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal. Each merge commit was checked with `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/main`
at `bb609b449a` (2026-10-07). The quoted blocks are copied verbatim from the sprint and gate records (links
re-pointed to this file's location).

Per-sprint gate (Travis, 2026-10-06): focused `just test`, a GLM 5.2 tmux run, one independent Opus 5.5 High
review and SOP demo videos, then merge behind the feature flag. **Not claimed:** the milestone code-blind VM run,
human sign-off, flag removal and the P1 hardening plan. Carried-forward items are recorded as open, not done.

## PF-33-S01: URL, DNS and redirect destination policy

Summary: tests `cargo test -p codex-network-proxy pf_33_s01` (23) and `-p codex-core pf_33_s01` (1); `cargo test -p codex-network-proxy` 265 + 16 contract tests. TUI run: GLM 5.2 tmux runs through the real proxy. Review: Opus 5.5 High review and re-checks, dispositioned.

- `pf33s02-pinned-dial`: Connection pinning: each request connects only to the DNS answers the destination guard checked: https://github.com/CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal/releases/download/demos/pf-33-s02-pf33s02-pinned-dial-cde3d0f49988-2026-10-06.mp4
- `pf33s02-sandbox-egress`: Alternate-egress denial: the sandbox reaches only the proxy (no loopback services, raw DNS or Unix sockets): https://github.com/CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal/releases/download/demos/pf-33-s02-pf33s02-sandbox-egress-cde3d0f49988-2026-10-06.mp4

- `pf33s02-upstream-proxy`: Alternate-proxy denial: the guard refuses to send traffic through an inherited upstream proxy: https://github.com/CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal/releases/download/demos/pf-33-s02-pf33s02-upstream-proxy-cde3d0f49988-2026-10-06.mp4
