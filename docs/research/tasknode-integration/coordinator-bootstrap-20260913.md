# PF-80-S01 — management bootstrap allocation

Product initiative under **Internal delivery control — TO BUILD**, September13
explicit five-part goal; [full coordinator contract](../../../coordinatorInstructions.md).
This allocation preserves the entire objective, not a replacement MVP. Parent
coordinates startup until the Fable manager is qualified. Other product work and
old automations remain paused; no main/release or live Task Node bulk operation.

September13 scope amendment: Travis removed Tailscale/private off-Mac dashboard
access from the goal. Existing loopback serving and direct-SSH publication remain;
no public exposure or successful HTTPS claim is authorized. Historical access
attempts below are retained, but no longer block launch. Preserve frozen case
texts and defer only their remote-dashboard-access portions under this decision;
all remaining independent functional, Slack, recovery and recurrence gates remain.

## Ownership and code boundaries

Base eb01bf006eacbeef5be07174a3f37ad124abc74c. Parent canonical worktree/branch:
`worktrees/management-workstreams-20260911`, `integrate/management-workstreams-20260911`.
Launcher worker: `worktrees/fable-launcher-20260913`,
`bootstrap/fable-launcher-20260913`, same base. Paths are relative to Corbanu root.

- Fresh Astra High launcher worker: ONLY `scripts/initiative_control/fable_launcher.py`,
  `scripts/initiative_control/test_fable_launcher.py`,
  `qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/fable-launcher.md`.
  Own no credentials, shared registration, source state, service or policy files.
  Target 1200 total lines, hard 1500; stop for reallocation if required.
- Parent: `scripts/initiative_control/coordinator.py`, `coordinator_cli.py`,
  `integration.py`, `test_coordinator.py`, `test_integration.py`, plus existing
  `control.py`, `decision_alerts.py`, `decision_manager.py`, `decision_feed.py`,
  `slack_transport.py` and their exact associated tests as required for linkage.
  Parent owns product/plan/sprint updates, approved private state, live Slack/HTTPS
  configuration, mainline registration and rehearsal evidence. First durable
  coordination/integration unit target 1600 total/900 non-test; hard 2000/1200.
  Later UI/live bridges get an explicit scope update before implementation.

No Rust or dependency-cache campaign. Same-sprint disjoint workers are not extra
initiatives. Shared edits and receiving tests remain serialized.

## Sequential core owner-controls allocation

### DEC021 mixed-feed inspection correction — September13

Next same-sprint worker is a fresh Astra High context in
`worktrees/decision-inspection-20260913`, branch
`bootstrap/decision-inspection-20260913`, base239f7f82d5d410adb936963ef6be891a9184bbdd.
Parent temporarily delegates exactly `scripts/initiative_control/decision_inspection.py`,
`decision_feed.py`, `attention.py`, `test_decision_inspection.py`, and
`qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/decision-inspection.md` in that checkout.
Target500 changed lines/hard700, at most350 implementation lines. One Fable High
material review plus necessary scoped correction; previous budgets/findings remain.
Parent owns shared allocation, receiving, publication, private state and actual
independent functional execution. No worker source/state/service changes elsewhere.

Original DEC021 requires useful sanitized content alongside withheld unsafe input.
Preserve strict canonical `decisions.validate/save_fixture` and every Slack
resolution/dispatch gate: an invalid canonical feed remains invalid and cannot
authorize a decision or reply. Restore read-only inspection of unrelated, wholly
validated records; never repair fields, silently choose duplicate IDs, prune part
of a decision history, or convert invalid input into an authoritative valid feed.
An invalid top-level envelope, ambiguous JSON, untrusted file or oversized input
still exposes no record content. For a valid envelope with invalid records,
validate each complete decision/history independently and withhold every copy of
any duplicate ID. Preserve the exact valid siblings without synthetic rewrites.
If none survive, retain the existing invalid/unknown representation.

Use a bounded inspection-only snapshot extension (schema3) when valid siblings
survive: canonical `feed` stays null and overall input invalid, open count unknown.
Bind the safe inspection and numeric withheld count into the existing immutable
artifact digest; no excluded text/IDs/paths or raw payload enters exports.
The renderer must prominently say input is incomplete and records are for
inspection only, with total open count unknown, no fresh-empty/all-clear claim,
no Slack delivery/answer authority and no inference that workers are running.
Keep useful summaries/evidence, history, exact sprint links and timestamps;
refresh never upgrades completeness. Existing schema1/2 valid behavior stays
compatible. Unsupported older readers fail closed on schema3; no sender uses it.

Tests retain validated pre-poison baselines and prove valid-plus-invalid siblings,
secrets in current/history/link fields, all-invalid/envelope/duplicate/byte/owner
failures, partial transfer tampering, source drift, actual export/activate/publish,
unknown aggregate health, useful rendered evidence and no disclosure, unchanged
canonical bytes and strict Slack rejection. Existing tests remain unchanged.
No live credentials, inference, services, external network, other agents/reviews,
Rust/dependencies, commits/pushes or product continuation by the worker. Return
literal diff, test commands/exits, file hashes and remaining functional limits.
Original DEC/SLK cases remain frozen; engineering checks do not pass them.

### Full disposable lifecycle rehearsal after db8afbba3

Parent owns `/private/tmp/life.TuWkuY/` for the next operational rehearsal:
one owner script, one fixed receiving script, a disposable Git fixture and generated
private receipts. Target250 authored operator lines/hard350. Reuse the integrated
Coordinator, manager cycle, fresh Fable launcher and single-writer Integrator;
do not create another runtime framework or edit production lifecycle code here.
One scoped Fable High operator-script review plus necessary corrections preserves
prior review history. Synthetic sprint IDs, gates and repository contents must
remain explicitly labelled; real manager and native-tool receipts may not be faked.

Exercise a fresh Fable integration proposal, an actual fresh Astra High receiving
executor, exact merge/test verification, prepared owner completion, actual fixture
document archival, separate activation authority and an actual fresh successor
worker from the verified receiving base. Capture fresh-process reopening and
duplicate/premature/stale denial with unchanged state, plus retained failure and
restart evidence. Actual source archival is owner work, not inferred from SQLite.
The fixture has no remotes, credentials or product services. Only the trusted
parent uses the existing authorized Fable auth file; never pass it to workers.
No real product completion, production coordinator mutation, recurrence, Task Node
send, main/release or remote deployment. Full combined functional/Slack/private
access gates remain separate. Parent owns all shared plan and evidence updates;
each receiving/successor worker gets one bounded allocation and no descendants.

### Adaptive pending-event batches

After cfffcd3f0, parent owns `coordinator.py`, `manager_cycle.py`,
`test_coordinator.py` and `test_manager_cycle.py` under `scripts/initiative_control/`,
this allocation and one QA receipt. Target 350 changed/160 implementation lines;
hard 500/220. One fresh Fable High material review plus scoped corrections,
preserving prior review history. Nash's reviewed ca0474fe4 remains frozen for
later receiving integration; no worker is concurrently editing these files.

The core currently selects up to 24 pending events regardless of briefing bytes.
Before inference, allow the trusted owner to restrict an existing fresh manager
claim to an ordered nonempty prefix, with revision/pause/deadline/identity checks.
No event is consumed by selection. The driver chooses the largest prefix that
fits the unchanged evidence/byte limits, records the original and selected claims,
and exposes the deferred count. Preserve all three workstreams, last-three action
ordering, frozen allocations and every original body needed by the selected
packet. Only acceptance consumes the selected events; failed/stale/oversized-first
cases leave pending history intact. Never skip ahead past an oversized first event,
truncate evidence, call inference repeatedly or alter already launched claims.
Tests cover durable restart/partial drain, selection rollback and stale/paused/
expired/invalid claims, plus actual retained-packet sizing before a fresh manager.
This is internal PF-80-S01 bootstrap, not product resumption or recurrence.

### Lossless action-input indexing after the receiving launch hold

September 13: Nash's owner-transition candidate ca0474fe4 has a clean Fable
review, but its receiving-manager attempt hit the 64 KiB briefing gate before
launch. The original attempt and earlier TMUX path-length failure remain
retained. Parent owns a bounded correction in `manager_cycle.py` and
`test_manager_cycle.py` under `scripts/initiative_control/`, plus this allocation
and a QA receipt under `qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/`.
Base 5b1d343df; target 100 changed lines/hard 160, one scoped Fable High review plus
necessary correction, preserving prior reviews. Index only action inputs that
exactly match their current frozen allocation and digest, with explicit manager
reconstruction instructions. Preserve changed/historical inputs verbatim, raw
claims, original evidence, last-three ordering, all limits and authority checks.
Do not trim evidence, edit durable history or auto-retry failed manager claims.
Tests prove lossless reconstruction, changed/digest-mismatched inputs and large
repeated assignments. Parent remeasures the retained actual failed packet before
an explicitly reconciled fresh manager. Product dispatch/recurrence remain paused.

### Executable owner-only lifecycle transitions

Next unit after the actual native receiving checkpoint and460-test combined
regression: fresh Astra High worker in `worktrees/owner-transitions-20260913`,
branch `bootstrap/owner-transitions-20260913`, base
`b004bb06c1b7aad432c0633ffdf319b2d247d8df`. Exactly four authored paths:
`scripts/initiative_control/coordinator.py`, `coordinator_cli.py`,
`test_coordinator.py`, and `qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/owner-transitions.md`.
Parent relinquishes those four files until handoff. Target600 changed lines/
250 implementation-only; hard850/350. One fresh Fable High material review plus
necessary scoped correction; preserve all prior unit budgets/findings. No new
daemon, schema migration, external dependency, shared policy/plan/sprint edit,
credentials, service, live state, main/release or native/Slack call by the worker.

Concrete gap: current completion and successor APIs require already-accepted
actions; their CLI tests advance those actions through synthetic native worker
receipts. Ordinary NativeOwner excludes these kinds. Complete the trusted
owner's executable path from a fresh manager's prepared lifecycle proposal to
its actual transaction without invented native IDs/dispatch/ACKs. Preserve the
existing accepted-action compatibility path and all receipt/gate/dependency,
pause, revision, resource and archive checks. An authorization or preparation
receipt must not be described as a completed effect. Do not silently activate
from a prepare-only proposal: explicit activation authority remains required.

Prefer a small explicit owner-only API/CLI transaction over a generic command
executor. Atomic successful lifecycle change must record its real owner receipt
and terminal action state; failed/stale/duplicate/wrong-kind or insufficient-gate
requests must leave all state/evidence/event tables unchanged. Preserve claimed,
uncertain and running worker ownership: this path cannot bypass a native claim.
Cover complete/archive/successor progression with normal prepared manager actions,
no fake native lifecycle for the owner operations, and a dependency-gated first
successor claim from the verified receiving base. Include independent failure/
restart/duplicate and premature successor tests; retain all existing tests.
Actual source-file archival and final full-loop qualification remain parent work,
not something SQLite alone proves. This implements the existing five-part goal,
not sprint completion, product resumption or recurring enablement.

### Passive wait recording, after the actual driver rehearsal

Parent implements the next small internal unit in `worktrees/coordinator-wait-20260913`,
branch `bootstrap/coordinator-wait-20260913`, base
`9bafae46ba615768d9fff3e72c6beddf54771f95`. Exact four paths:
`scripts/initiative_control/coordinator.py`, `coordinator_cli.py`,
`test_coordinator.py`, and `qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/wait-recording.md`.
Target200 changed lines/100 non-test, hard300/150. One Fable High material review
plus necessary scoped correction, preserving previous units' ledgers.

Add an owner-only revision-bound operation to record an already accepted manager's
prepared `wait` proposal as durably observed. Retain its rationale, frozen allocation
and evidence; do not invent a worker, claim, ACK or completed product task. It may
record an intentional wait while dispatch is paused, without changing pause state,
sprint lifecycle, human decisions or dependencies. Reject every other action kind,
already claimed/terminal waits, stale revisions and changed allocations. No new
meaningful event for this passive bookkeeping: otherwise wait completion would
continually reawaken Fable. Keep its audit/evidence and existing terminal-history
retention. Tests cover CLI/restart, duplicate/stale denial, all other kinds, active
ownership and more than48 successive waits without a growing pending queue. Parent
owns receiving integration and actual existing-wait recording after review; no
recurrence, dispatch, broader passive side effects or completion gate is authorized.

After accepted core84f16cceec87292296ff94a9d431a86d23a9fe52, a fresh Astra High
worker owns only `scripts/initiative_control/coordinator.py`, `coordinator_cli.py`,
`test_coordinator.py` and `qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/owner-controls.md`
in `worktrees/coordinator-bridge-20260913`, branch
`bootstrap/coordinator-bridge-20260913`, base84f16cceec87292296ff94a9d431a86d23a9fe52.
Parent relinquishes those four files until handoff. New unit target600 changed
lines/350 non-test, hard950/550; this is a new authorized bootstrap unit, not
unbounded extension of the completed first review. No live state/credentials,
launcher, integration.py, dashboard, Slack, policy or scheduler writes.

Deliver supported revision-bound owner controls to add/replace exact frozen
allocations and enable/pause an individual stream without reinitializing SQLite;
do not silently mutate a claimed allocation or leave prepared claims executable
against changed scope. Add explicit completion/archive and successor transition
operations that require verified receiving/action evidence and owner-checked
mandatory gate records; dependency predicates alone are not completion. Preserve
the three-reservation limit, owner-only authority, pause precedence, audit history,
wrong-revision/duplicate/restart refusal and the distinction between claims and
acceptance. Tests must prove these paths and denials through the CLI. No actual
sprint is completed/archived by this implementation or its synthetic tests.
The parent performs Fable material review and receiving integration, then owns
actual native tool/rehearsal wiring in a subsequent explicitly allocated unit.

## Bounded actual native handoff rehearsal

After owner-controls receiving `fc7656ee370e33277f093144ba1ccf773fb2afc4`, the
parent may exercise one actual fresh-manager decision and one fresh Astra High
acknowledgment/reconciliation worker using the existing owner CLI and private
operator artifacts. The worker has zero write scope: inspect only this canonical
checkout's branch/HEAD/clean status and confirm the launcher/owner-control entry
points exist. No product work, reviews, builds, source edits, services, credentials,
network, document archives, Task Node sends or additional workers. Bind its ACK
to the exact claim/allocation digest and its actual native identity before work.
Capture actual return and independent owner comparison, close the worker, retain
pending/history records and return global/delivery dispatch to paused afterward.
Both other streams remain paused throughout. This is one operator-driven bridge
rehearsal, not proof of a deployed automatic event controller or recurring loop.

## Read-only Slack reply collection allocation

Sequential bootstrap unit from receiving `327eade129e186a5c66a3bacbf60c2342771de86`:
fresh Astra High worker in `worktrees/slack-reply-poll-20260913`, branch
`bootstrap/slack-reply-poll-20260913`, owns only
`scripts/initiative_control/slack_reply_poll.py`, `test_slack_reply_poll.py` in
the same directory, and `qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/slack-reply-poll.md`.
Target 650 total/350 non-test lines, hard 850/450. Parent retains all existing
modules, registrations, credentials, live state and scheduling. One Fable High
material review plus necessary in-scope corrections; prior review history remains.

Deliver one bounded owner-invoked collector using an injected authenticated Slack
WebClient and the existing durable Coordinator event API. Exact owner-pinned
team/bot/human/channel and tracked thread-to-decision mapping, never discovered
from untrusted replies. Read replies only; no Slack sends, canonical resolutions,
worker dispatch, service/automation enablement or credential loading in the worker.
Persist original bounded reply evidence with stable deduplication across repeated
polls/restarts and distinct edited revisions. Pagination must not silently skip
answers: bounded partial scans expose continuation/coverage, not a false caught-up
claim. Failure/429 and unknown/deleted/malformed evidence must stay explicit;
polling cannot prove unseen deletions or replace qualified Socket Mode ingress.
No approvals inferred from text and no message text in diagnostic stdout. Recording
events is allowed with product dispatch paused. Tests cover real API-shaped
fixtures, identity/thread/author rejection, duplication/edit/restart, pagination,
partial results, failure and persistence-before-observed semantics. No live API
or credential access by this worker. Parent owns actual bounded replay and later
monitor activation after the relevant launch gates; this is not recurring enablement.

## Event-to-manager driver allocation

Next bounded unit after collector receiving and actual read/dedup, base
`bca6485a2e60803393bbca0ee56d98953022ed12`: fresh Astra High worker in
`worktrees/manager-cycle-20260913`, branch `bootstrap/manager-cycle-20260913`,
owns only `scripts/initiative_control/manager_cycle.py`, its adjacent
`test_manager_cycle.py`, and `qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/manager-cycle.md`.
Target800 total/450 non-test lines; hard1050/600. Parent retains coordinator,
launcher, native tools, private credentials/state, policy and scheduling. One
Fable High material review plus necessary scoped corrections, retaining history.

Build the minimal owner-invoked one-cycle driver on existing Coordinator and
`fable_launcher.run_launcher`, not a new daemon/framework. No native tool API is
callable from this Python module: return accepted prepared actions for the actual
host coordinator; never synthesize spawn/ACK/return or integrate anything here.
Observe enabled/owned/pending state before inference; refuse duplicate cycles.
Claim the existing manager token, freeze an owner-only briefing/artifact record,
include the three workstreams and their last three actions plus original selected
event/result evidence, and call the actual fresh launcher once. Enforce64KiB
before inference, expose missing/oversized evidence as an owner hold without
silently truncating it or consuming events. Trusted owner context is bounded data,
not model-authored policy. Describe the seed as historical and allow separately
dated owner observations; no invented current facts. Prompt short rationales under
300 bytes while preserving the core's hard1000-byte limit and exact frozen inputs.

Bind successful receipt to this manager token, exact briefing digest, binary and
actual model/provider/high/session/turn/complete-response/shutdown evidence before
calling `accept_decision`. Retain unsuccessful/stale/invalid attempts and report
ownership/reconciliation requirements; never retry the model implicitly or clear
uncertain ownership based on elapsed time, a caller boolean or PID guess. An owner
uses existing reconciliation after actual shutdown inspection. No credential load,
network, tools or state writes at import/help/OFF; execution uses the existing
explicit private auth path only through the launcher. Test injected launcher
receipts, empty/paused/owned, evidence overflow/missing, wrong identity/digest,
stale revision, failed shutdown, crash boundaries and successful accepted action.
Those fixtures are not live-manager or native-dispatch qualification. Parent owns
actual fresh-manager replay, native bridge, future supervision and recurrence.

### Actual driver and uncertain-dispatch rehearsal

After corrected driver review and verified receiving integration, the parent may
run one fresh Fable cycle through that actual driver and allocate one fresh Astra
High worker for an ACK-only native handoff. Its scope is zero writes, zero product
execution, no credentials/network/builds/reviews, and no descendants. Bind the
actual native receipt and exact allocation digest; do not manufacture tool results.
Exercise the crash window between actual spawn and durable `dispatched` recording:
retain the host receipt, inspect the actual agent, let the real claim deadline
expire, run the watchdog in a new process, and verify uncertain/duplicate denial.
Reconcile the known native identity, record its genuine ACK, close it through the
actual tool, and reconcile shutdown as failed/cancelled rehearsal work, not success.
Use a fresh manager to observe that terminal result. Security/accounting remain
paused; only this explicit delivery allocation may run, with global/delivery pause
restored in finally/recovery. Preserve all attempts, including any unexpected hold.
No sprint completion, successor implementation or recurring enablement is implied.

## Isolated model transport enforcement allocation

Stage A review02 is clean, while its four failed capability probes remain failed.
Parent authorizes a fresh Astra High worker to implement the next wrapper-owned
transport unit, not to relabel the diagnostic as accepted. Exactly four authored
files under `.codex-work/model-transport-b.I8BDWp/`: `model_only_transport.py`,
`model-only.json`, `test_model_only_transport.py`, `README.md`. Generated private
evidence is retained beneath that root. Target850 total/450 non-test lines,
hard1000/550; one Fable High material review plus necessary scoped corrections.
PF-80-S01 and its canonical worktree remain the governing allocation. No product
worker, Rust edit, shared script, service, real credential or remote change.

Read the frozen Stage A source/evidence without modifying it. Reuse its pinned
0.1.41 package and exact Astra High model-only catalog. Enforce startup-input
exclusions at the OS boundary even when synthetic AGENTS/skills/hooks/plugins
canaries exist; a newly empty home or disabled-config assertion alone is not proof.
Keep the fixed owner command builder closed to guest argv/model/effort overrides.
Set supported request/stream retry limits and verify actual request counts for
HTTP failure and dropped streams. Preserve wall/output bounds, no helper tools,
no external network/Keychain/home/source access, immutable catalog/owner evidence,
child confinement, cleanup and positive package/text controls. Actual negative
read probes must demonstrate denial, not only marker absence or nonexistent files.

Tests use only synthetic auth and a bounded loopback HTTP fixture, preserving all
failed attempts and wire identities. This may qualify the constrained local
transport profile, not an entire reasoning executor: credential mediation, target
PTY/browser actions, independent frozen-case execution and evidence review remain
explicit later gates. Do not substitute arbitrary HTTP proxying or a native host
tool for that mediator. Report exact files, counts, hashes, tested effective policy,
supported override evidence and any remaining failed gate; stop at the hard scope
limit. Parent receives the result and owns live qualification/allocation afterward.

### Transport B owner correction: supported private provider alias

Feynman returned788/361 lines and closed: the OS/text diagnostic passes, but the
normal profile rejects reserved built-in `model_providers.openai` before inference.
Original four-file source is retained in `evidence-02y437g5/four-file.diff` with
hash manifest and failed replay `evidence-es59ei5y`. Do not alter that evidence.
Parent verified an existing supported custom-provider route, not a source bypass:
fixed alias `isolated-openai-transport`, display name `Isolated OpenAI transport`,
Responses wire, `requires_openai_auth=true`, zero request/stream retries and the
same synthetic loopback service/model/catalog. Actual pinned0.1.41 normal output,
503 and dropped stream each sent exactly one Astra High/Responses Lite request
and cleaned up. Preserve `evidence-parent-alias-3tdui4rw` (bad dictionary/TOML probe)
and corrected `evidence-parent-alias-4qiiy100` (supported scalar fields).

Parent owns this same four-file correction, inside the unchanged850/450 target
and1000/550 hard scope. Replace only the rejected built-in provider configuration
with that fixed alias, qualify every ordinary test through the actual execute path,
retain explicit default-policy diagnostics and all original failures, then obtain
the already-allocated Fable High material review. This is no model substitution,
new endpoint/auth store or permission expansion. It does not authorize live auth,
a public proxy, Rust validation changes or acceptance of functional product tests.

## Supported live model-transport preflight

After transport B review01 and its clean documentation correction, parent owns
one bounded native-auth preflight under `.codex-work/transport-live.ZBeaq9/`.
Exactly one operator script `probe.py` plus generated private attempts/receipts;
target200/hard300 authored lines. This uses the goal's bounded live qualification
authority, not product execution. Frozen B source/fixtures remain unchanged.

Pin the same0.1.41 binary, catalog, model-only flags, fixed custom provider alias,
Astra High and zero request/stream retries. Send only a fixed nonsensitive text
probe through Corbanu's supported ChatGPT authentication and native endpoint
selection. Parent verified `/Users/Neo/.codex/auth.json` is0600 with ChatGPT-mode
credentials and an access expiry September15; do not print, copy to an executor,
export, refresh or rewrite credentials. The trusted model transport may read that
exact existing auth file; it is not the future confined action executor. Its empty
environment and read-only auth access must exclude host config, instructions,
skills, history, source, Keychain and unrelated credentials. Capture only validated
assistant output in the public receipt; raw operator diagnostics stay private.

A preliminary Seatbelt domain-filter syntax check rejected `chatgpt.com:443`:
the filter accepts only `localhost` or `*`, not a hostname. Use HTTPS-port egress
in the trusted model transport plus the fixed native default ChatGPT endpoint,
normal TLS verification and no caller-supplied URL/headers/argv or executable tools.
This is not domain-specific OS filtering or guest network authority; disclose the
layered bound. Keep fork/helper execution denied,90s wall and256KiB output caps,
private fresh state, exact process-group cleanup and immutable source-auth hashes.
Preflight/failed connection attempts are retained, no silent retry or model fallback.
An auth expiry/refresh failure holds live admission and uses supported operator
reauthentication outside this read-only probe; it is not permission to clone more
credentials or relax their protection. No recurring operation or product test pass.

First attempt `attempt-rk_95g3z` failed in-process app-server initialization before
a session because native state was pointed at the read-only real auth home. Keep
that denial and unchanged-auth receipt. Use a fresh private home with one
owner-created auth.json symlink to the same exact read-only source file; the
explicit source-file read allowance is unchanged. Do not grant real-home writes,
copy tokens or expose this link to an executor. This separates native working
state from the already-authorized supported auth read without broadening access.

Second attempt `attempt-a5uobjaw` started a fresh native session but failed sending
the HTTPS request; source auth remained unchanged. A separate unauthenticated
curl diagnostic reproduced DNS denial and then reached the native endpoint
(HTTP401, as expected without auth) after allowing the exact macOS resolver
socket `/private/var/run/mDNSResponder`. Authorize that socket only for the trusted
transport, in addition to HTTPS443, not general UDP/Unix-socket or guest access.
Preserve both failures and a new per-run policy receipt. Keep the fixed profile's
two exact web-search deprecation warnings separately identified; they are not
runtime failures. All other error items and failed/error events still fail the
preflight, regardless of whether expected text was also emitted.

DNS-only corrected attempt `attempt-zii29ueb` still failed HTTPS without changing
auth. The inspected shared `http-client/src/custom_ca.rs` supports `SSL_CERT_FILE`
and selects Rustls for an explicit PEM bundle, avoiding a grant to user Keychain
services for native TLS. Authorize reading only the existing root-owned public
system bundle `/private/etc/ssl/cert.pem` via this supported environment setting;
record its hash and immutability. Do not disable certificate/hostname verification,
add a private CA, change host trust settings or allow Keychain access. This is an
explicit separately recorded preflight correction, not a claim about frozen B.

## Isolated-executor transport falsification allocation

### Local Docker boundary feasibility, parallel to fixed-transport extraction

Read-only host inventory found Docker Desktop27.5.1 running Linux6.12.5-linuxkit,
ARM64, with cached `python:3.12-slim` image
`sha256:944a73bd27d7b5fad206369e77bb7a6da51e073236b9dece9ff387df433de7bb`
(repository digest `python@sha256:57cd7c3a7a273101a6485ba99423ee568157882804b1124b4dd04266317710de`).
A cached ARM64 Scrapling browser image also exists, but no browser runtime has
been launched or qualified. UTM lists two stopped macOS VMs; no VM was started.
VMware's read-only inventory command stalled and only that command was terminated.
Docker reports its default seccomp profile as unconfined: do not inherit that as
an accepted sandbox. This is a potential local Linux route, not current isolation
proof or a replacement for private remote dashboard access.

Parent owns a separate three-file engineering probe in
`.codex-work/docker-boundary.WcQbTX/`: `probe.py`, `guest.py`, `seccomp.json`,
target300/hard450 authored lines plus generated private receipts. No overlap with
Hilbert's five canonical files. Use only the pinned cached Python image, no pull
or installation, and owned disposable containers. Non-root, read-only root,
no capabilities/new privileges, private PID/IPC/network namespaces, networknone,
explicit seccomp denying namespace/mount/ptrace/host-control operations, finite
memory/CPU/PID/tmpfs limits. No Docker socket, credential/home/source/state mount;
the only host bind may be this exact synthetic guest script, read-only.

Probe actual parent/child source/history/credential namespace exclusion, symlink
escape, package/root writes, forbidden syscalls and external networking, plus
private scratch/interpreter/loopback positives and effective resource/config
records. Distinguish namespace invisibility from EPERM and kernel limits from
actual exhaustion. Bound owner Docker calls/output and retain failed attempts;
remove only validated, labelled containers created by this probe, after capturing
terminal state. No host Docker-daemon/VM/security-policy changes or existing
container stops. One scoped Fable review after engineering proof plus necessary
correction, preserving prior reviews. This does not qualify a browser, product
binary or independent reasoning executor; later bounded stdio mediation may avoid
host-network/socket exposure but needs its own explicit allocation and proof.

### Canonical fixed-transport extraction, after the live preflight

The successful native preflight closes the model-connection uncertainty only.
Authorize one fresh Astra High implementation worker in the separately recorded
`worktrees/isolated-model-transport-20260913`, branch
`bootstrap/isolated-model-transport-20260913`, from the commit containing this
allocation (record its exact40-character base in the dispatch receipt).
It owns exactly five new canonical files: `scripts/initiative_control/isolated_model_transport.py`,
`test_isolated_model_transport.py` and `isolated-model-catalog.json` beside it,
plus `qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/isolated-model-transport.md`
and its own `transport-allocation.json` in that QA directory. Target900 total/450
non-test, hard1200/600; one Fable High material review plus necessary corrections.
This is one sequential PF-80 bootstrap unit, not a new initiative. Parent owns
all existing modules, private auth/state, live requests, integration and activation.

Extract the already-proved fixed trusted model transport into an import-safe,
testable host library; preserve the B profile/catalog/package pins and explicit
DNS/public-system-CA corrections. An immutable owner configuration selects exact
verified binary/auth/run-root paths, never guest data. The only per-inference
content is bounded UTF8 text; no guest-selected argv, model, effort, providers,
endpoint, headers, files or tools. Fixed Astra High, native auth/endpoint, zero
retries, fresh private state, source-auth read-only link, original policy denials,
90s wall and256KiB aggregate output. A packet may be up to64KiB, so replace B's
4KiB pipe-safe fixture shortcut with genuinely bounded nonblocking input/output.
Preserve attempts/receipts and exact error-versus-known-warning classification.
Return only validated text and safe identity/status receipts; raw diagnostics
remain owner-private. Import/help/OFF must not read auth or invoke a process.

Tests use synthetic credentials and test-only injected loopback/child fixtures,
never real auth/network. Cover same actual public execution path for input/output
bounds, timeout/cleanup, malformed/unknown/error events, unchanged auth/catalog,
path/symlink/package refusal, fresh-session identity and no fallback/retry. Retain
the private B negatives as historical supporting evidence, not tests of changed
code. Parent performs actual exact-candidate OS/live requalification afterward.
No socket mediator, browser/PTY executor, HTTP proxy, daemon, worker dispatch,
Slack call or source profile rewriting is part of this extraction. Those remain
explicit next integration gates, not excuses to expose host capabilities.

Parent inspected the read-only Hypatia audit and verified the Astra catalog's
`code_mode_only` precedence in source. Its inspected default standalone0.1.36
is not our current0.1.41 candidate; preserve that limitation. RTX SSH timed out,
so no remote packaging, forwarding or runtime claim is established. The existing
646-line/12-test five-file boundary runner and all old evidence remain frozen.

September13 host clarification: Travis confirms RTX belongs to a different
tailnet; Alex's RPC uses direct SSH. The parent verified direct
`pfrpc@178.156.143.199` access independently of Tailscale. RPC has bubblewrap0.9.0,
Python3.12.3 and systemd255.4; these are not the RTX runner's versions. A bounded
rootless namespace/`true` probe failed with `bwrap: loopback: Failed RTM_NEWADDR:
Operation not permitted`. RPC is not yet an accepted replacement executor. No
host policy, packages, tailnet or network isolation were changed to bypass it.
Private browser access is a separate route qualification, not an SSH/publication
prerequisite. Stage A remains local/offline and does not wait on either tailnet.

Authorize only Stage A locally now: fresh Astra High worker may create exactly
four private files under `.codex-work/executor-route-audit.Nerv9u/model-only-v1/`:
`model_only_transport.py`, `model-only.json`, `test_model_only_transport.py`,
`README.md`. Target650 total/400 non-test; hard850/550. This is manager-owned
infrastructure within PF-80-S01, not PF81 activation or a fourth initiative.
No canonical source edits or second storage/proxy/daemon framework. Parent owns
the one Fable High boundary review and necessary corrections. The audit's
eight-file full executor proposal is not simultaneously allocated.

Use exact existing macos-candidate-final9 Corbanu0.1.41
SHA256 `4a8eba7b10199ea49aee42a720687b63cb4b1b2194c2ce164d1b9f6f88ee510e`.
Build the smallest fixed model-only command/profile on supported CLI/catalog
configuration, with a neutral direct-mode Astra entry preserving required wire
metadata. Explicit Astra/High, no fallback/session reuse, no operational tools,
hooks, host docs/memories or guest-selected paths/providers/commands. First test
only synthetic owner-private homes, file auth and loopback fixture servers; never
read/use real auth, Keychain, models or external network. Bound processes, output
and cleanup; inspect captured real request/response and hostile unadvertised tool
calls for shell/file/image/MCP/code-mode/collaboration/extension capabilities.
Exercise synthetic hook/notify/AGENTS/memory/plugin/config canaries and ordinary
text success/invalid configuration failure. Distinguish wire-content proof,
unsupported-tool responses, marker absence and filesystem-denial proof honestly.

Return exact package/profile/catalog/argv hashes, actual tests and failures,
remaining limitations and frozen four-file diff. If supported configuration
cannot remove a required capability, identify the exact remaining registration
and stop that admission path for a separately scoped source correction. No
prompt-only isolation, live credentials/inference, remote SSH/forwarding, namespace
changes, full mediator/action loop or product/browser/Slack acceptance is authorized
by Stage A. Parent chooses and allocates subsequent enforced executor work after
examining this falsification evidence and current machine reachability.

## Isolated browser prerequisite allocation — September13 receiving8665ff1c9

The accepted text transport and corrected Docker boundary do not yet provide
visual observations or an action executor. Authorize two disjoint bounded
prerequisites, preserving their original evidence and all product pauses.

Fresh Astra High worker in `worktrees/isolated-image-transport-20260913`, branch
`bootstrap/isolated-image-transport-20260913`, base
`8665ff1c962ff2a6aa6a3157eb2251942d438c3f`, owns exactly
`scripts/initiative_control/isolated_model_transport.py`, its existing adjacent
`test_isolated_model_transport.py`, and new
`qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/isolated-image-transport.md`.
Target400 changed lines/200 non-test, hard650/350. Parent retains integration,
policy, real credentials and actual native qualification. One fresh Fable High
material review plus necessary scoped corrections, with previous reviews retained.

Add one optional bounded inline PNG observation to the existing public text
execution method. Never accept an image path, URL, guest-selected flags or a new
provider/model. Keep text-only callers unchanged, OFF inert, all existing tool,
credential and process restrictions. Validate byte size and PNG dimensions before
launch; reject unsupported/malformed inputs. Store only validated bytes under one
fixed owner-created exclusive private per-attempt filename. Verify the exact
packaged CLI's supported image attachment syntax, grant read access to that one
file only, and pin/hash its bytes before and after execution. No image editing,
remote fetch, new dependency/parser framework or broad directory read permission.
Tests use synthetic images/auth/fixtures and the existing execution path; cover
OFF, rejection before auth/process, bounds, unchanged text behavior, exact argv,
read policy, image mutation and preserved failure evidence. This is internal
transport engineering, not independent visual functional acceptance. Parent owns
the later actual native screenshot-observation proof and isolated action loop.

Parent owns at most three authored files under a new private
`.codex-work/docker-browser-*` root: `probe.py`, `guest.py`, `README.md`, target300
lines/hard450, plus generated evidence. Inspect and launch only cached ARM64 image
`sha256:fdbf57e27079258be976cf5d8d309c1c00faadfc24cec5c562caf661b27926bd`
with the already-reviewed corrected seccomp policy, non-root/read-only root,
no network/capabilities/new privileges, private IPC/PID and bounded resources.
No pull/install/host service change, auth/source/socket/profile mounts or user
container operations. The single permitted bind is the synthetic guest script,
read-only. Inventory installed browser/Playwright paths and attempt a synthetic
local-page render, screenshot and actual keyboard/mouse interaction. Browser
children remain under the outer container boundary; record any browser-specific
sandbox limitation rather than weakening the container policy. This preflight is
engineering, not acceptance of dashboard, Slack or a full reasoning executor.
Persist create intent before the Docker request; after any ambiguous create, hold
further admission until exact labelled-container owner reconciliation. A missing
immediate inspect result cannot close that uncertainty. Preserve failed attempts,
effective runtime/config hashes, and remove only exact validated owned containers.
Parent reviews the actual observations before allocating the combined action loop.

Actual non-root inventory found Playwright1.59.0 in `/app/.venv`, but its Chromium
1217 cache lives under image-only `/root/.cache/ms-playwright`, inaccessible to
UID65534. Parent authorizes extracting only that pinned image's public
`chromium-1217` runtime from a never-started labelled disposable container to the
same new private probe root, then mounting the extracted directory read-only at
`/browser` for the synthetic probe. Record extraction intent, image identity and
all runtime file hashes; reject links/special files before reuse. No host browser
profile, real user home, credentials, source or socket is copied. This does not
grant root execution, modify the cached image/host permissions or install packages.
The original single-bind inventory remains historical; the browser attempt has
exactly the guest-script and public-runtime read-only binds. `/tmp` stays noexec.

## Fixed confined browser guest allocation — September13

Fresh Astra High worker in `worktrees/isolated-browser-guest-20260913`, branch
`bootstrap/isolated-browser-guest-20260913`, exact base
`72429ddaec4ab0f2dd19f4e59da8d095c6bc39a8`, owns exactly
`scripts/initiative_control/isolated_browser_guest.py`, adjacent
`test_isolated_browser_guest.py`, and
`qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/isolated-browser-guest.md`.
Target650 total/350 non-test, hard850/450. This disjoint PF80 bootstrap unit may
proceed while parent finishes image-transport qualification. It does not import
or depend on the unfinished image change: host mediation remains parent-owned.
One scoped Fable High review plus necessary corrections; no reset of prior ledgers.

Implement the fixed guest-side browser action loop, not a host agent or Docker
launcher. It runs only inside the parent-provisioned confined environment. No
model/auth/service/SSH/Docker calls or host browser use by the worker. Import/help
must not launch a browser. Use cached Playwright1.59.0 at actual runtime, no new
dependency install. One fixed Chromium `/browser/chrome-linux/chrome`, fresh
profile, read-only `/packet/site` assets and owner-only frozen `/packet/case.json`.
Serve that directory only on private127.0.0.1:8768; packet supplies exact case/run
identity, relative entry path and desktop1440x900 or phone390x844 profile. Validate
paths and packet fields; no source/debugger/auth/history assets or optional plugins.

Expose bounded strict JSONL over stdin/stdout, one sequential request at a time,
unique monotonic sequence and latest frame identity. Actions are only observe,
bounded viewport click/hover, literal text, enumerated key, bounded scroll, back,
reload and finish. No arbitrary URL/path/selector/eval/shell/config/upload/download
or host callback. Observe returns bounded body text with explicit truncation,
viewport screenshot PNG, current URL and fresh frame identity. Reject stale-frame,
unknown/duplicate keys, bad types, nonfinite/out-of-bounds coordinates and exhausted
budgets before acting. Text and Enter are distinct. Unknown/failed operations must
not imply success or silently retry. Limit action frames to8KiB, text4KiB, per-action
timeout5s,40actions and300s whole guest run. Preserve structured terminal reason;
parent owns durable raw I/O, process-tree watchdog and container reconciliation.

Only the private local fixture origin may navigate/request; no file/remote URLs,
downloads, popups or service workers. Chromium inner sandbox remains explicitly
disabled within the outer enforced container, not an independence claim. Guest
application checks supplement that boundary; they do not substitute for it. Test
protocol and fake-browser adapters without actual model/browser service access;
parent performs real confined runtime/child denial and subsequent independent
case execution. No original DEC001..026 changes or functional pass declarations.

## Publication pause correction — September13

Maxwell's actual one-shot publication of14019e412 succeeded as build-sagn5ou_,
but the inherited installer unconditionally enabled the render timer, violating
the bootstrap pause. Parent disabled only corbanu-control-publish.timer and
verified disabled/inactive; the web service remains active. No product resumed.
Parent owns the bounded correction in activate.py, test_control.py,
test_decision_feed.py (existing activation call-count assertion), README.md
under scripts/initiative_control/, this allocation and bootstrap QA. Remove the
implicit timer enablement: source activation may publish once and refresh the
web service, but must not change the operator's timer activation state. New
installations remain unscheduled until separately authorized. No new scheduler,
timer policy, flag, product dispatch or worker ownership change. Target100 changed
lines; one scoped Fable High review plus necessary correction, followed by actual
one-shot deployment and disabled/inactive verification. Prior review usage stays.

## Run-bound browser isolation proof — September13

### Live cross-run IPC prerequisite after full lifecycle rehearsal

Completed internal prerequisite: [actual assignment, three retained runs and
review disposition](../../../qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/live-crossrun-ipc-20260913.md).
Worker returned/closed; parent pinned the manifest and replayed successfully.
This does not qualify another executor or waive the full frozen-case gate below.

Next bounded qualification under the same PF-80-S01 source worktree: fresh Astra
High worker owns only `probe.py`, `ipc_guest.py` and `README.md` under the existing
empty private `.codex-work/live-crossrun-ipc.osUMyY/`, plus generated per-attempt
evidence there. Target400 authored lines/hard550. No canonical source or prior
runner edits. Parent owns Fable allocation, one material Fable High review plus
necessary scoped correction, receiving evidence and later per-case runner linkage.

Use only the already pinned cached ARM64 browser image, public extracted Chromium
runtime and explicit reviewed seccomp policy from the accepted browser-boundary
runner. Two owned disposable containers use nonroot65534, networknone, private
PID/IPC, readonly root, zero capabilities/NNP and existing finite resource bounds.
Prove a live peer IPC endpoint works in its own namespace before and after the
other executor and its forked child cannot reach it. Preserve actual errno and
namespace identities; distinguish namespace separation from file-permission denial.
Include local IPC positives and an actual browser launch/UI positive in the tested
executor; no model inference or real credentials. A live synthetic peer is not
an actual native Codex agent, and this prerequisite alone is not functional acceptance.

Persist exact create intents; use bounded commands, exact image/name/label ownership,
and remove only the containers this attempt created after terminal evidence.
Unknown create/cleanup outcomes remain held across restart, never automatically
retried from a missing immediate lookup. No image pulls, packages, other container
changes, user files/auth/source mounts, host services, external network, reviews
by the worker, descendants or product resumption. Return exact hashes, attempts,
positive/negative results, cleanup evidence and the minimal future per-case hook;
the complete frozen dashboard/Slack cases remain the subsequent owner gate.

Parent's fixed244-line screenshot/action engineering at private
browser-model-live.yDoShR passed two real fresh Astra High turns; Fable review01
had one nonblocking provenance clarification, retained in its QA. No portable
runner or independent acceptance is inferred. Next parent-owned private
browser-model-boundary.OKK8iU owns run.py, denials.py and README.md, target450
authored lines/hard550 plus generated evidence. Reuse the accepted controller
and existing Docker parent/child syscall probes, adapting only the already-used
512MiB/128PID/oneCPU browser resource limits. Add existing unreadable synthetic
source/history/auth directories and a synthetic socket behind an unreadable
directory so EACCES is distinguished from missing host paths. This proves a
protected IPC path, not separation from another live agent's IPC. Preserve the
earlier Mac-shared socket EOPNOTSUPP as an unsuccessful test, not a permission
denial. Keep raw canaries out of model observations.
The extra readonly mounts are only the fixed probe and synthetic denial fixtures;
never actual source, prior findings, user credentials or host automation sockets.
Execute those probes in the actual browser container and its child before the
model action loop; require live renderer restrictions and clean process/container
removal. Failed probe means no model call. No new network authority, root use,
packages, recurrence or PF81 activation. One material Fable review plus necessary
correction; preserve previous review usage and all attempts. Parent separately
owns the later complete frozen-case runner and independent evidence handoff.

## Launcher interface for coordinator integration

### Native owner bridge — next bootstrap unit, September13

September13 actual lifecycle follow-up: source2093475e8 has reviewed native
spawn/ACK/send/return/close-gap proof; the next actual manager attempt held before
launch with `briefing_size_hold`. Parent owns a bounded lossless briefing fix in
`scripts/initiative_control/manager_cycle.py` and `test_manager_cycle.py`: the
last-three list must refer to the complete records already in `actions`, not
repeat them. Preserve ordering, every original evidence body/digest, limits,
authority and failed claim. No truncation or automatic failed-manager retry.
Target80 changed lines; one scoped Fable High review plus necessary correction
authorized within the existing integrator delegation. Receiving integration of
the native bridge follows the reviewed repair and an explicit fresh manager.
Actual failed packet re-encoded at61,668/65,536 bytes with all39 originals and
every ordered action preserved. Combined manager/core/launcher tests104 passed
in85.594s; Fable review `01a09c57-c7e6-74e1-b026-553f508f986e` clean. The original
hold had only claim/hold files and no launch; owner explicitly reconciled it at
revision125 without consuming its events. New live handoff remains to be run.
The next pre-launch attempt exposed additional duplicate preview text after the
allocation-base replacement: complete brief65,840 bytes. Parent's same-boundary
correction removes only derived previews at known core event/action-reference
positions; all original bodies, frozen inputs and raw claim packets remain.
No arbitrary data objects are rewritten. Scope target revised to120 lines for
the two real failures, with one corrective Fable review; no hard-limit increase,
event deletion, automatic retry or packet/authority protocol replacement.
Correction passes73 manager/core tests in2.857s and Fable corrective review
`01a09c5d-966b-7ea0-96e9-dce8d1332201` is clean. The actual second failed packet
now fits52,277 bytes with all46 originals, no omissions. Owner reconciled that
verified no-launch claim at revision132. Both original holds remain auditable.

Original implementation allocation, now closed after receiving atd3f742ac3:
fresh Astra High worker owned only `scripts/initiative_control/native_owner.py`,
`scripts/initiative_control/test_native_owner.py`, and
`qa/initiative-control/management-bootstrap/native-owner.md` in
`worktrees/native-owner-20260913`, branch `bootstrap/native-owner-20260913`,
base a3368e443e09a9acfd1dd8c74432d9924ed8cd69. Parent retains all existing
modules, state, Slack, integrations, policy and scheduler. Target900 authored
lines/500 non-test, hard1200/700. One Fable High material review plus necessary
correction; retain all prior review usage. No live effects by the worker.

Implement the reusable trusted-owner bridge between accepted coordinator actions
and actual native subagent tools. Use existing Coordinator APIs, not a second
manager or replacement state machine. Expose bounded owner-invoked operations
and a trusted adapter interface for spawn/send/status/close; adapters are supplied
by the owner, never imported or selected from events/model output. Production
native tools remain host-owned; injected test adapters must be labelled fixtures.
Persist intent before each non-idempotent external operation. Exact real agent
identity, allocation-bound startup ACK, work-submission receipt, return and close
must be tracked. Obtain an ACK before sending the actual assignment. Interrupted
spawn/send/close requires actual reconciliation, never automatic repeat. Polling
may resume after restart; an observation timeout is not worker termination.
Keep pause/dependency/resource/stale-allocation checks at existing owner/core
boundaries, including immediately before work submission. Returned work is not
accepted, merged, completed or successor authority. Surface those next owner
actions explicitly; do not silently leave returns in a running state.

Include executable bounded CLI/stdio handoff to actual host tools, rather than
only an abstract adapter or a prose recipe. No arbitrary commands, credentials,
dynamic imports, automatic manager retries or autonomous scheduler. Focused tests
must cover real durable SQLite restart, duplicate requests, both effect/receipt
crash windows, wrong identity/ACK, pause between ACK and work, running/timeouts,
terminal failure and return awaiting verification. Parent exercised this
with real native agents and existing Fable cycle; wiring recurring operation waits
for the whole bootstrap gate. Internal-only N/A for browser/TUI here;
actual native lifecycle proof is mandatory before operational acceptance.

Standalone CLI reads a bounded JSON briefing from `--briefing`, fresh private
`--runs-dir`, exact `--binary`, owner-only `--auth-file`, bounded `--timeout`.
No network on help/import/offline tests. Its stdout returns one redacted JSON
receipt containing run_id, status, model, provider, effort, session_id, decision
and artifact paths. Errors/timeouts return a nonzero exit and retained receipt.
An outer caller supplies credentials privately; never put credential values in
briefing, argv, stdout or exported artifacts. Exact model claude-fable-5-1-plan,
provider claude-plan, effort high; no fallback/resume/shared session history.
Use actual Corbanu interactive TMUX, separate text/Enter, full final response
capture and authoritative session identity. Fresh application home and neutral
packet CWD; tools restricted to required read-only manager work. A new home is
context isolation, not full functional-executor containment.

Manager decision JSON: `state_revision` integer, `actions` list. Each action has
stable `id`, `kind`, `workstream`, `sprint`, `rationale`, `inputs` object,
`timeout_seconds` and exact `expected_revision`. The coordinator validates the
allowed kind, policy authority, scope, dependency/receipt state and revision;
the launcher validates only framing, actual model/session and complete response.
Never treat pane quietness or a JSON snippet in tool output as final acceptance.

## Full completion evidence

1. Fresh Fable: two actual independent runs, correct model/effort/session IDs,
   complete structured decisions, bounded timeout/cancel and clean shutdown.
2. Coordination: durable event → fresh manager → validated action → actual native
   worker dispatch → ACK/result → new event; deduplication, stale decision denial,
   crash/restart and silent-stall watchdog tests. No fake dispatch receipts.
3. Integration: exclusive writer, actual temporary Git merge/receiving test and
   receipt; concurrent writer denial, conflict/failure recovery, branch/candidate
   checks and dependency-complete successor promotion. No unchecked worker claims.
4. Slack: actual authenticated question, actual human reply, canonical decision,
   native-agent ACK and restart/recovery; approved audience and reply-authority
   tests. Preserve old journals. Off-Mac dashboard access is explicitly deferred.
5. Initialization/rehearsal: real three-lane baseline and approvals, aligned policy,
   complete handoff and failure/restart rehearsal, then qualified recurring enablement
   and final Slack completion ping. Until then no completion or running claim.

## Verification and limits

Use exact nonzero test receipts, all prior failures retained. Initial internal
launcher/queue engineering has reasoned internal-only N/A for GUI acceptance;
the later combined dashboard/Slack workflow requires independent code-blind
design/execution/evidence under root policy. Do not relabel smoke tests as that gate.
One fresh Fable material review per returned unit plus necessary correction;
extensions preserve prior PF80 usage and require purpose, not a reset.
Do not grow an unbounded process framework: implement these explicit operations
on existing Corbanu, native tools, private state and supported Slack machinery.
