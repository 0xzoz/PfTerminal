# Corbanu Terminal

## Product definition

**Purpose:** Build the best possible tool for AI agents to trade on the blockchain.

**Product promise:** Give an agent stablecoins, market data, compute, and permissioned financial tools; let the user direct it conversationally; improve the user’s trading process; and permit action without exposing strategy, credentials, or financial information.

**Product boundary:** Corbanu Terminal is a trader-first, wallet-native AI terminal. It is not a generic coding harness, website builder, or corporate assistant. It tracks the strongest upstream behavior from Codex—the general-purpose agent-harness lineage underlying the Terminal—while preserving Corbanu’s trading, provider, wallet, security, identity, and social layers.

## Positioning

Corbanu Terminal is a cyberpunk capital-compounding machine: wallet-native, pseudonymous, powerful, social, and secure enough for real financial work.

Marketing language belongs in this positioning section. Delivery requirements below are operational.

## Product principles

1. **Trader-first:** Every product decision must improve research, backtesting, execution, risk control, or learning.
2. **Security is the product:** Prompt injection, vault extraction, financial-data leakage, and unauthorized financial action are P0 risks.
3. **Wallet-native:** Minimize email, credit-card, real-name, and custodial dependencies without promising avoidance of venue-specific identity or compliance requirements.
4. **Integrate, do not rebuild:** Use strong broker-agent services, data providers, stablecoin rails, and Post Fiat infrastructure.
5. **Private means explicit:** Distinguish Corbanu-controlled inference from third-party inference at selection and use.
6. **Visible control:** Show what an agent can read, disclose, propose, approve, sign, and broadcast.
7. **Upstream velocity:** Maintain continuous Codex parity without removing Corbanu-specific behavior.
8. **One product:** Identity, data, inference, skills, execution, NAV, and social must feel native to one Terminal.
9. **Deterministic authorization:** A model deciding that an action looks safe is never authorization.

# Shipping MVP — LIVE

Corbanu Terminal already exists and is shipping. The roadmap expands this live, multi-provider MVP into the complete trader product; it is not a prerequisite for Corbanu Terminal to exist.

| Area                         | Shipping capability                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Runtime**                  | Rust, Apache-2.0, Linux/macOS/Windows, the `corbanu` command, and legacy `pfterminal` command and state compatibility.                                           |
| **Multi-provider inference** | OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude Plan, Kimi, Z.AI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ambient, Meta, Baseten, Vercel, Bedrock, Ollama, LM Studio, Corbanu Plan, and custom providers. |
| **Vault and credentials**    | Encrypted `/vault`, masked entry, metadata-only inspection, and operational credential use without placing raw values in chat.                                   |
| **Named profiles**           | A provider selected or linked while a named profile is active is durably owned by that profile, restored after restart, and unavailable to other named profiles. |
| **Agent orchestration**      | Sauron → Nazgul → Troll → Orc orchestration, model-aware delegation, durable mailboxes, supervision, resume, and recovery.                                       |
| **Workspaces**               | `/panes`, `/agent`, approvals, existing general sandboxing, review, MCP, skills, plugins, apps, connectors, and background terminals.                            |
| **Wallet and payments**      | Local Solana wallet, SOL and canonical USDC support, scoped signing, backup/restore, and Corbanu Plan purchase/recovery.                                         |
| **Compute**                  | Vast.ai and RunPod rental workflows with price, spend, duration, readiness, stop, and termination controls.                                                      |
| **Task Node and identity**   | Tasks, evidence, verification, rewards, balances, chat, context, linked identity, and **live Task Node-linked Nostr identity**.                                  |
| **Remote and context**       | Allowlisted Telegram; durable `/goal` and `/memories`; ephemeral `/side` and `/btw`; `/skills` and `/docs`.                                                      |

## Live MVP versus the P0 security controls

The shipping MVP already has a wallet, vault, scoped signing, approvals, and
general workspace sandboxing. These are live product capabilities.

The new `/security` surface makes additional protection understandable and
user-controlled. **Permissive preserves the shipping behavior and does not
silently change existing policies.** Moderate and Aggressive add deterministic
protections around untrusted content, sensitive data, credentials, tools, and
financial actions.

## Permission selection confirmation — TO BUILD

Travis explicitly expanded the permission repair scope on September 14, 2026
to include app-server confirmation while retaining next-turn command permissions.
A submitted selection is not a confirmed change. The TUI must distinguish
requested, applied-to-next-turn, failed and uncertain results using an outcome
correlated to that request, including unchanged selections. Existing active-turn
approval/sandbox snapshots and pending approvals are not retroactively changed.
Show a clear finish/stop-current-turn and continue path without automatic
interruption, command approval or replay. Existing shared-service policy behavior
is preserved; do not claim every service waits for the next turn.

Keep old-client/server compatibility explicit: unsupported or acceptance-only
replies cannot be presented as applied confirmation. Error, disconnect and
restart recovery must not claim success or retry an uncertain change blindly.
This is confirmation plumbing and truthful UI, not a new authorization policy,
global quiescence, protected-mode activation, or live application replacement.
The existing security/permission initiative owns its separately allocated PF-83
feature; the isolated broker remains paused, not cancelled or completed.

# Corbanu Plan — LIVE; DEPRECATION TARGET

Corbanu Plan is wallet-native, one-calendar-month prepaid inference purchased through **x402**, normally using canonical USDC on Solana. The wallet proves ownership and receives a revocable Plan credential. Every tier uses the same model catalog and differs by allowance.

The public Corbanu API and Plan gateway base URL is **`https://api.corbanu.com`**. Infrastructure-provider hostnames are compatibility addresses, not customer-facing product surfaces.

| Tier    |    Price | Weekly allowance | Monthly allowance |
| ------- | -------: | ---------------: | ----------------: |
| Starter |   1 USDC |             250K |                1M |
| Basic   |  20 USDC |               5M |               20M |
| Power   |  50 USDC |            12.5M |               50M |
| Pro     | 200 USDC |              50M |              200M |

| Models                          | Backend | Privacy boundary                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| GLM 5.2, Kimi K2.7 Code         | Ambient | Private, Corbanu-controlled inference. |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro, Claude Fable 5 | xAPI    | Non-private, third-party inference.    |

**x402 is payment. xAPI is inference.** Customers authenticate to Corbanu Plan, not directly to xAPI.

Mainline xAPI uses a protected server-side operator credential and balance gate. A separate branch implements per-wallet xAPI accounts, encrypted tenant keys, capped refills, and wallet-level cost attribution. That work is **BUILT NOT LIVE** until it is merged, deployed, and verified in production.

Model-specific cost normalization, Plan margin targets, and other commercial performance targets are **TBD**. The listed allowances must not be interpreted as equal upstream cost across models.

# Corbanu API — TO BUILD

Product decision: Alex Good, Head of Product, 2026-08-30. Replace new Corbanu
Plan sales with a wallet-funded, dollar-denominated Corbanu API balance. Alex
Good amended the migration decision on 2026-08-30: Corbanu has one production
user, so all legacy paid periods, plan credentials, token allowances, receipts,
and dependent entitlement records are retired and deleted instead of being
grandfathered. Wallet assets and Corbanu API balances, keys, and ledgers are not
legacy plan data and remain intact.

The user tops up with canonical USDC and receives the same number of dollars of
Corbanu API credit. There are no Starter, Basic, Power, or Pro purchase tiers,
calendar-month renewals, or weekly/monthly token allowances for new funding.
Usage debits the balance using an explicit versioned price for input, cached
input, cache creation where applicable, and output tokens. Reservations,
settlement, idempotency, and insufficient-balance enforcement remain atomic and
server-authoritative.

The paying wallet owns one balance shared by its API keys. The first successful
top-up can create a default API key. Its plaintext is returned and displayed
only once through a secure non-transcript view; the service stores only a keyed
hash and display prefix. An unlocked wallet can create and revoke additional
keys without another payment. Each key retains separate creation, last-use,
revocation, request, and spend attribution.

The customer-facing model catalog uses Corbanu identities and displays Corbanu
prices without identifying the upstream compute vendor. The privacy boundary
remains explicit: every route is labeled either **Corbanu-controlled** or
**third-party inference**. Provider credentials and internal routing metadata
never enter model context or customer responses.

Initial intended routes are GLM 5.3 Flash (**Recommended**), GLM 5.3 (labeled as
using balance faster), GPT-5.6 Luna at xhigh, GPT-5.6 Sol, Kimi K3, and
DeepSeek V4 Pro. Alex Good replaced Claude Fable with Kimi K3 on 2026-08-30
after direct SkyAPI qualification found no available Fable channel. Vercel is
the internal route for both GLM models, the two OpenAI models, and Kimi K3;
xAPI remains the preferred internal route for DeepSeek where it is cheaper and
passes reliability checks. Internal routing may change
without changing the public model identity or price during an in-flight request.
Customer pricing is exact upstream cost with zero markup, adopted by Alex Good
on 2026-08-30. Each request pins a versioned upstream route and price schedule;
catalog and ledger records expose the customer rate without exposing the vendor.

Legacy Corbanu Plan names, purchase/recovery/details surfaces, entitlements, and
inference authorization are not part of the product. New and existing UI,
payment, account, and inference flows call the product **Corbanu API**.

# Target product

The expansion roadmap must make the following one coherent trader product:

- native equities and crypto market data;
- first-party reproducible backtesting;
- first-party Hyperliquid support;
- seamless use of existing brokerage-agent services;
- a clear `/security` surface with Permissive, Moderate, and Aggressive levels;
- native Post Fiat NAV infrastructure;
- a first-class Corbanu trollbox using live Task Node/Nostr identity;
- wallet-funded inference, data, and financial tools;
- USDAI as the preferred stablecoin partner rather than centering a Corbanu-native token;
- continuous upstream Codex parity.

# Users and decisions

| Persona             | Primary job                                                                              | Product decision implication                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Buyside Bro**     | Improve personal Hyperliquid or DEX trading without linking activity to a work identity. | Default to private research, pseudonymous identity, explicit disclosure controls, and bounded execution. |
| **Hobbyist**        | Explore and observe AI-assisted trading safely.                                          | Lead with guided research, reproducible backtests, paper trading, and approval-required actions.         |
| **Accelerationist** | Deploy technically capable agents on-chain.                                              | Provide machine-readable tools and constrained autonomy without weakening deterministic controls.        |
| **Crypto AI Guy**   | Use an AI harness that remains explicitly crypto-native.                                 | Keep wallet, stablecoin, venue, identity, and agent workflows native rather than bolted on.              |

All personas prefer reduced centralized identity, custody, and data collection. Corbanu must not imply that pseudonymity overrides a provider’s legal, jurisdictional, KYC, AML, sanctions, or account requirements.

# Discovery and activation

Corbanu Terminal is distributed through **Corbanu.com**, the newsletter and media property for on-chain stock ideas. It appears near the subscription surface and in videos and live demonstrations.

The first interaction must be immediately useful. For example, “Corbanu, show me a chart of AAPL” should lead naturally to approved native data and then to research, a replayable backtest, a monitored idea, or a permissioned execution workflow.

# Accountable sequencing

Security is the first implementation initiative and begins immediately. Other
roadmap items have their own owners and plans; they are not dependencies or
scope for the `/security` implementation plan.

# P0 `/security` levels

## Product surface

`/security` opens one focused tab showing the current security level, a short
plain-English explanation, the protections that change at each level, and a
confirmation step before applying a change.

| Level          | Product promise                                                              | Policy behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Permissive** | Preserve the Corbanu Terminal users have now.                                | Default for existing users. Existing approval, sandbox, vault, wallet, tool, network, and agent policies are unchanged. The tab explains that no additional security controls are active.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Moderate**   | Add strong protection without making normal agent work painful.              | Treat external content and tool output as untrusted; prevent secrets and protected financial data from entering model-visible context; require trusted credential resolution; separate proposal, approval, signing, and broadcast; show the expected effect before protected actions; record redacted audit events; support revocation and a kill switch. |
| **Aggressive** | Minimize sensitive access and require the user to open every important door. | Includes Moderate, then defaults sensitive tools, account access, credential use, protected-data disclosure, financial actions, arbitrary egress, and clipboard/export paths to denied. The user grants narrow, expiring access; every sign or broadcast requires exact human approval; child agents inherit the level and cannot weaken it.              |

Permissive must be verified against the pre-feature candidate so selecting it
does not silently tighten or loosen an existing policy. Moderate is the
recommended level once qualified. Aggressive is an explicit lockdown posture,
not a marketing label.

Only the human can change the level through the TUI. Agents, prompts, project
files, tools, hooks, plugins, connectors, MCP servers, and retrieved content
cannot change or downgrade it. A confirmed change applies immediately to active
and future agents, invalidates incompatible pending approvals, persists across
restart, and produces a secret-free audit event.

## Reconciled security scope — TO BUILD

The 2026-08-28 product decision preserves Permissive compatibility and makes the
broker mandatory for both Moderate and Aggressive. It authorizes the
[P0 security plan](plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md) to reconcile the
working-session overview/transcript, archived security designs and OpenClaw
implementation into one program; these outcomes are not yet shipped.

Protected modes include isolated credential execution and secretless agent
launch; reflected-secret/output protection; safe migration and clean-context
recovery; provenance that survives summaries, memory and child agents; isolated
retrieval, screened search, network validation and download promotion;
sanitization, local detection and quarantine; exact-origin brokered login with
human authentication challenges; bounded financial execution, derived views
and disclosure controls; Agent Sweep; and an inspector of actual protection,
degradation and secret-free audit state.

Optional hosted detection and advisory review remain disabled until qualified
and explicitly consented. Search/security adapters and existing wallet/fake-venue
qualification are included; new trading venues, commercial agreements, paid
service activation and live financial actions are not authorized by this
planning decision. Unknown or unsupported protected paths fail visibly rather
than falling back to raw secrets or unscreened execution. The plan owns the
detailed contracts and sprint sequencing.

## Release rule

Moderate and Aggressive controls must be deterministic policy around the model,
not prompt text. A model may identify risk or propose an action, but cannot
authorize itself, resolve a secret, change the security level, or bypass a
protected-action decision.

## Required trust boundaries

The added boundaries and controls below apply to Moderate and Aggressive;
Permissive preserves the existing policies specified above and does not acquire
an implied secretless guarantee.

1. External content enters as untrusted data.
2. The model may research and propose but cannot resolve secrets or authorize itself.
3. Credentials are referenced by label and resolved only inside a trusted execution boundary.
4. Account reads, order construction, approval, signing, and broadcast are separate permissions.
5. Deterministic policy evaluates every proposed financial or disclosure action.
6. Signing and broadcast occur only after policy and approval requirements pass.
7. Audit records capture decisions and identifiers without exposing secrets.

## Non-negotiable controls

- Treat webpages, transcripts, social posts, trollbox messages, files, email, tool output, and retrieved text as **untrusted data**, never executable instructions.
- Classify instruction intent and provenance before external content can influence tools or financial actions.
- Keep vault values, seeds, private keys, broker credentials, balances, positions, PNL, and identifying financial data out of model-visible context except for narrowly scoped derived values.
- Permit agents to reference credentials only by label; resolve them solely inside the trusted execution boundary.
- Default to no secret export, arbitrary egress, clipboard exposure, or sensitive logging.
- Separate research, account reads, order construction, approval, signing, and broadcast.
- Require explicit venue, destination, asset, size, leverage, price, slippage, time, notional, and loss limits.
- Simulate and display the complete expected effect before signing.
- Support allowlists, denylists, rate limits, daily loss/notional/leverage caps, cooldowns, revocation, and a kill switch.
- Block vault enumeration, credential extraction, portfolio disclosure, policy changes, approval bypass, and unapproved value transfer.
- Detect duplicate, stale, conflicting, and ambiguous financial actions.
- Record tamper-evident policy decisions, tool calls, approvals, signatures, and transaction or order IDs without secrets.

## Required adversarial tests

### Data-rollback scope decision — 2026-09-04

Travis Good confirmed that rollback protection must cover restoration of older
Corbanu data, not restoration of an entire machine snapshot. A separately
protected local controller checkpoint is an acceptable authority: restoring,
deleting or replacing agent-accessible policy/journal data must not restore
authority while that checkpoint survives. The trusted operating system,
administrator and controller storage remain outside the untrusted-agent boundary.
Whole-machine rollback resistance, TPM monotonic state and an off-host anchor
are not required for this scope. Missing or corrupt protected state still fails
closed; this decision does not authorize automatic reset, privileged deployment
or real credential migration.

### Attack coverage

The release suite must cover:

- direct and indirect prompt injection;
- tool-output and retrieved-content injection;
- vault, seed, credential, and financial-data extraction;
- confused-deputy attacks;
- malicious plugins, connectors, and MCP servers;
- trollbox and social-engineering attacks;
- unauthorized policy modification or approval bypass;
- unauthorized venue, asset, destination, leverage, or notional;
- duplicate, replayed, stale, and ambiguous actions;
- sensitive log, clipboard, or egress leakage;
- kill-switch, cooldown, revocation, and limit failures.

**Pass condition:** Every critical attack-class regression passes and no critical finding remains open.

# Trader capabilities

## First-party backtesting skill — TO BUILD

### Inputs

- hypothesis;
- universe;
- horizon;
- approved data source;
- benchmark;
- strategy constraints.

### Required behavior

- Prevent or explicitly detect look-ahead, survivorship, timestamp, corporate-action, and delisting errors.
- Include fees, spread, slippage, financing, borrow, and venue-specific assumptions.
- Support equities, crypto spot, perpetuals, and NAV strategies through adapters.
- Produce trades, equity curve, drawdowns, exposure, PNL attribution, and machine-readable results.
- Record data version, code, parameters, model, and environment for replay.
- Use Corbanu-controlled private inference by default for proprietary strategy work.
- Promote eligible results to paper trading and then to approval-gated execution.

A **reproducible backtest** is one that can be rerun from the recorded data version, code, parameters, model, environment, and cost assumptions, with discrepancies surfaced rather than silently ignored.

## First-party Hyperliquid skill — TO BUILD

- Read approved market and account data, positions, margin, funding, orders, and fills.
- Draft, simulate, place, replace, and cancel orders.
- Enforce leverage, notional, slippage, loss, venue, and instrument limits outside the model.
- Support paper, approval-required, and constrained-autonomy execution modes as separately gated.
- Support builder or referral codes where applicable.
- Never expose exchange credentials to the model.
- Audit every proposed, approved, rejected, and executed action.

## Brokerage-agent layer — TO INTEGRATE

Corbanu must connect existing first-party broker tools, MCP servers, agent accounts, and aggregation services through their own secure authorization flows rather than rebuild brokerage infrastructure.

The Terminal must normalize:

- accounts and balances;
- positions;
- orders and fills;
- permissions and limits;
- connection health;
- recent proposed and completed actions.

Default access is read-only. Corbanu must preserve venue-specific capabilities and requirements, keep credentials outside prompts, and give users a consistent experience across crypto venues, retail brokers, and institutional services.

| External layer                     | Examples from current product context                    | Corbanu approach                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Broker-native agents               | Robinhood, IBKR, Public, Webull, Coinbase, eToro, Moomoo | Integrate approved existing agent surfaces.                                    |
| Developer brokerage infrastructure | Alpaca                                                   | Use the infrastructure and make permissions native and visible.                |
| Multi-broker aggregation           | SnapTrade and similar services                           | Normalize supported brokers through one Corbanu permission layer.              |
| Consumer agent apps                | End-to-end AI trading products                           | Differentiate through security, pseudonymity, extensibility, and one Terminal. |

## Post Fiat NAV — TO INTEGRATE

Make Post Fiat NAV infrastructure native to Corbanu Terminal rather than a separate expert workflow.

The supported Terminal experience must:

- discover NAV products;
- inspect strategy, assets, venues, NAV, reserves, proofs, liquidity, privacy, and risk;
- build, research, and monitor portfolio or NAV strategies;
- subscribe using supported stablecoins and track the resulting position;
- construct supported private OTC or NAV swaps;
- expose proof, settlement, privacy, redemption, and exit state in human- and machine-readable form;
- support exit and redemption as Post Fiat infrastructure makes those flows available;
- use Corbanu data, backtesting, Hyperliquid, wallet, security, and agents as the operating front end.

Reference: [Post Fiat](https://postfiatorg.github.io/).

# Social: Corbanu trollbox

**Status:** TO BUILD
**Priority:** P1

The trollbox is a first-class trading and agent surface, not a community sidebar.

Required capabilities:

- real-time pseudonymous chat using Task Node identity and its already-live Nostr integration;
- rooms for tickers, markets, agents, strategies, and NAV products;
- visibly distinct human and agent identities;
- reputation grounded in Task Node work, evidence, and history;
- structured cards for charts, backtests, positions, tasks, and NAV objects;
- moderation, mute, block, report, spam control, and identity-level reputation;
- explicit consent before sharing balances, positions, orders, PNL, wallets, or private research;
- security classification of every message and card as untrusted external input.

All agreements, licensing rights, provider terms, commercial targets, and fallbacks remain TBD unless explicitly stated above. Final decision rights are defined in the ownership table.

The intended experience is one coherent Corbanu relationship through which the user receives the appropriate inference, market data, and tools rather than manually assembling unrelated subscriptions.

# Target product loops

These are target expansion workflows, not claims that every step is live today.

## Idea → trade

1. Ask for an idea or chart.
2. Pull approved native data.
3. Produce a replayable backtest.
4. Promote the strategy to paper trading.
5. Stage a Hyperliquid or broker order under explicit limits.
6. Approve manually or execute inside an approved constrained-autonomy policy.
7. Return risk, PNL, and audit evidence to the strategy record.

## Trollbox → research

1. A Task Node/Nostr identity posts an idea.
2. Corbanu treats the post as untrusted social data.
3. The user explicitly elects to research it.
4. Approved data and transcripts feed a backtest or risk report.
5. Results appear as structured social cards without exposing account data.

## NAV

1. Discover a NAV strategy and inspect proofs, liquidity, privacy, and risk.
2. Research or backtest it.
3. Apply the active `/security` level and protected-action controls to every wallet or account action.
4. Subscribe, swap, monitor, exit, or redeem through supported Post Fiat flows.
5. Discuss the strategy through the trollbox without leaking holdings.

# Product measurement

## Internal delivery control — TO BUILD

September 13 management-bootstrap authorization: implement the five-part
coordinator goal recorded in [coordinator instructions](../coordinatorInstructions.md):
fresh Fable 5.1 High management through Corbanu/TMUX; durable event dispatch,
acknowledgments and watchdog; serialized verified integration; actual Slack
reply/decision/agent acknowledgment; initialize
and rehearse all three workstreams before enabling recurring operation. This
authorizes the bootstrap and bounded live qualification, not premature product
sprint resumption, new product scope, main/release or financial actions.

September13 scope amendment: Travis removed Tailscale/private off-Mac dashboard
access from the bootstrap goal. Keep private loopback viewing and direct-SSH
publication; remote browser access is deferred, not qualified or a launch gate.

Travis authorized up to three independent product initiatives on September 10,
then selected PF-13, accounting and Task Node integration on September 11.
Use sequential sprints per initiative, incremental merges behind verified
default-OFF feature boundaries, and a private read-only Alex-server dashboard.
One manager owns plan records and publication; workers emit separate redacted
reports. Show blockers, rendered sprints, human test plans, machines, run logs
and freshness; preserve the last good publication on failure. Task Node receives
only explicitly mapped, supported progress; no automatic reward, signing,
financial action or task-completion claim is implied.

Facilities is the private static operator link index for the existing media
interfaces on RTX PRO 6000 and Drone, with upstream repository links. Travis's
September 12 brief requests preserving this page across dashboard source moves;
it is not a model service or a claim of current service availability.

On September 11 Travis authorized correcting stalled orchestration: the manager
owns local receiving-branch integration, exact allocations within approved
features, successor preparation and concrete decision escalation under the
sprint execution process. This is not blanket main-push, release, deployment,
live-posting or product-contract acceptance authority.

On September 12 Travis delegated additional-review authorization to the named
integrator, particularly to unblock work. Preserve review history and move on
when reviews have no substantive unresolved findings. Root AGENTS.md owns this
execution rule; product and release acceptance remain separately authorized.

Travis requested persistent, contextual decision cards on this dashboard and
Slack alerts when human decisions stop work. He selected a dedicated private
"The Corbanu Project" channel in AmbientCrypto. The manager owns one decision
record with affected work, options, recommendation, impact and resolution;
dashboard and alerts are projections. Slack connection, exact destination and
delivery require verification; a question card or dashboard refresh is not proof
the human was alerted. No arbitrary Slack reply grants operational authority.

Travis's September 12 notice-format follow-up requests linked sprint summaries,
expandable issue context and an answerable question only when a decision is
needed. The matching Slack thread should log his answer and route it to the
appropriate agent through a verified identity/revision-aware manager handoff;
this two-way integration remains TO BUILD and requires qualified app access.

Travis additionally requested an ongoing public manual-testing beta program
under Task Node integration: a separate Corbanu Desktop beta branch/channel,
candidate-pinned public assignments, independent evidence review and bounded
human triage. Private evidence is not public by default; stable installs stay
isolated. Resolve Desktop source and public-board authority before readiness.
Planning and kickoff do not launch, offer rewards or waive root release policy.
See the [beta contract](plans/tasknode-beta-program.md).

Travis's September 11 follow-up, relayed by the PF13/provider-reauth owner,
adds standalone screenshot/inference QA infrastructure under delivery control:
an isolated fixture driver, strictly validated typed actions, bounded runs and
candidate-pinned evidence. Queue it after current delivery-control integration;
do not reactivate provider-auth or add concurrent work. Model output cannot
authorize arbitrary shell actions, credential access or a denied computer-use
surface. Live targets and inference endpoints require separate permission;
fixture success is not native-product acceptance.

## Campaign Tracker — LOCAL PILOT CANDIDATE

Authorized by the user's 2026-09-06 instruction to implement the reviewed Campaign
Tracker specification and test with `corbanu-debug --yolo`: preserve attributable
user prompts and compact GLM 5.3 Flash summaries in a bounded database, map work
to Task Node handles/tasks/context, dates, goals and repositories, and provide
permissioned historical replay in the Task Node tab. Manager views distinguish
human prompting, autonomous execution and verified outcomes. Recording requires
workspace enrollment; sharing requires an explicit scoped grant.

This adds product scope to the existing Task Node integration program as PF-78
in the active P0 plan (formerly P0 PF-45; see the
[identity reconciliation](sprints/identity-reconciliation-2026-09-10.md)).
It is not a bounded repair. The reviewed specification is
`/home/pfrpc/repos/campaign_tracker_spec_20260906.md`. Build and QA artifacts go
on the mounted data volume. Public deployment is a separate action.

Local capture, encrypted synchronization, Flash summaries, permissioned replay,
reviews and aggregate views are implemented. The [qualification record](../qa/campaign-tracker/2026-09-06/README.md)
distinguishes tested behavior from the remaining deployment, backup/restore,
advanced UI and pilot-calibration requirements.

## Open decisions

- Post-gate release dates: **TBD**
- Commercial KPI targets: **TBD**
- Tiingo, Sharadar, EarningsCall.biz, USDAI, brokerage, and Post Fiat negotiation states: **TBD**
- Partner fallback plans where not supplied: **TBD**
- Initial brokerage-agent provider selection: **TBD**
- Jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction feature availability: **TBD following required review**
- Per-wallet xAPI merge and deployment date: **TBD**

# Business model

Revenue comes from:

- wallet-funded Corbanu API usage and bundled data;
- referral or builder codes in execution workflows;
- commercial integrations;
- advertising through Corbanu.com;
- future Post Fiat NAV infrastructure where appropriate.

The economic center is useful stablecoin-funded activity, not a new token for its own sake.

Commercial ownership is defined in the roles table. Pricing rationale, revenue targets, conversion targets, and unit-economics thresholds are TBD.

# Glossary

| Term                              | Meaning in this specification                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Codex parity**                  | Continuous adoption of relevant upstream agent-harness behavior without losing Corbanu-specific capabilities.                                                  |
| **Task Node**                     | Corbanu’s task, evidence, verification, reward, balance, chat, context, and identity system. Its Nostr identity linkage is live.                               |
| **Nostr**                         | The live identity and social protocol integration linked through Task Node.                                                                                    |
| **Sauron → Nazgul → Troll → Orc** | Names for the live multi-agent orchestration hierarchy used for delegation, supervision, and execution work.                                                   |
| **x402**                          | The payment mechanism used to purchase Corbanu Plan.                                                                                                           |
| **xAPI**                          | A third-party inference backend; it is not the Corbanu Plan payment or customer-authentication layer.                                                          |
| **Post Fiat NAV**                 | External NAV infrastructure that Corbanu intends to make native for discovery, proofs, subscriptions, swaps, monitoring, exit, and redemption where supported. |
| **Private inference**             | Inference controlled by Corbanu, as identified in the Corbanu Plan model table; it does not describe third-party xAPI inference.                               |
| **Constrained autonomy**          | Live execution restricted to named accounts, venues, instruments, and deterministic signed limits enforced outside the model.                                  |
| **Native market data**            | Commercially authorized provider data accessible directly through Corbanu Terminal and its skills with source and replay provenance.                           |

# North-star acceptance test

The complete trader product passes when a pseudonymous trader can:

1. fund Corbanu with stablecoins;
2. choose clearly labeled Corbanu-controlled private inference;
3. obtain native equities and crypto data;
4. ask for an idea and run a reproducible backtest;
5. discuss it in the trollbox under a Task Node-linked Nostr identity;
6. promote it through paper trading;
7. deploy it through the first-party Hyperliquid skill or an integrated existing brokerage-agent service under the active `/security` level and explicit execution permissions; and
8. use supported Post Fiat NAV infrastructure as a native Terminal capability.

Throughout the loop, external content must be unable to prompt-inject the agent into revealing vault contents, exposing protected financial information, changing policy, bypassing approval, or moving money outside explicit deterministic limits.
