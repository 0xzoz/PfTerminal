## Windows non-admin sandbox

On Windows, Corbanu Terminal can sandbox commands in two ways. The **default
sandbox** needs a one-time Administrator setup. The **non-admin sandbox**
(also called the unelevated or legacy sandbox) needs no setup, but it protects
less.

**What the non-admin sandbox does not stop.** A sandboxed command can delete
or move files and folders outside your workspace when they sit in a folder you
own, which includes most of your user profile. This applies in both Read Only
and workspace-write modes. Creating or changing files outside your workspace is
still blocked. The default sandbox does not have this gap.

**When you will see a warning.** If your sandboxed commands run in the
non-admin sandbox, Corbanu Terminal tells you once per session:

- in the TUI, as a warning at startup and after you choose the non-admin
  sandbox during setup; the setup screens and `/permissions` also describe the
  risk;
- in `corbanu exec`, as a `warning:` line on stderr;
- in `corbanu sandbox`, as a `warning:` line on stderr before the command runs;
- in app-server clients, as a configuration warning.

The warning never blocks a command.

**Files a profile protects from reading.** The non-admin sandbox can't stop a
command from reading a file. So if your permission profile denies reading some
files (`deny` entries in your config, or the protected paths a security level
adds), Corbanu Terminal does not run the agent's commands in the non-admin
sandbox. The command fails with a message that it was not run because this
Windows sandbox mode can't block reading the protected files. The same applies
to a profile that limits which folders commands may read. Switch to the
default sandbox, as below, to run it. Profiles without such entries are not
affected.

**How to switch to the default sandbox.**

- In the TUI, run `/setup-default-sandbox` and approve the Administrator prompt.
  Corbanu Terminal saves the choice for later sessions.
- Or set the mode in `config.toml` in your Corbanu home folder:

  ```toml
  [windows]
  sandbox = "elevated"
  ```

  You can also pass `-c windows.sandbox=elevated` for a single run. If setup
  has not run yet, the first sandboxed command asks for Administrator approval
  once.

**Several sessions at once.** The default sandbox's read protections are
shared by every Corbanu Terminal session on the computer, whatever its Corbanu
home folder. When you remove a `deny` entry, its protection stays while any
other session that may rely on it is still running, and goes with the first
command you run after they have all ended. To track this, each session that
protects files registers itself in `C:\ProgramData\CorbanuTerminalSandbox`
while it runs. The sandbox setup creates that folder, owned by Administrators,
so updating to this version asks for Administrator approval once more. Until
the setup has run, and while that folder is missing or owned by anyone else,
no protection is removed; if that happens after the setup has run, sandboxed
commands with the secretless launch on are refused until you run the setup
again (it repairs the folder). Sessions started by an
older version are not registered, so their protections aren't kept for them.

**Over SSH.** The default sandbox also works when you start Corbanu Terminal
in a Windows OpenSSH session (or from a service). There, Corbanu Terminal
gives the command runner's logon (the SSH session's own, not the sandbox
accounts every Windows user's sandbox shares) the least access it needs in the
session's window station and desktop (no hooks, windows or clipboard). Once
the runner has started its command, that access shrinks to what the command
and its children need to start: they can't create desktops there, or open
your session's desktop unless `windows.sandbox_private_desktop = false`. It
goes when the runner exits, even if Corbanu Terminal has exited by then, so a
background process left running after its command ends can't start new
programs that need a window station. (If Corbanu Terminal is ended in the
moment between starting a runner and handing its access to the small helper
process that removes it, or that helper can't start and Corbanu Terminal
exits before the runner, that access stays until the SSH session ends.) The
non-admin sandbox with `windows.sandbox_private_desktop = false` works over
SSH too. Earlier builds couldn't run any command there: each one failed after
15 seconds with `windows sandbox: timed out after 15000ms connecting runner
pipe-in`, and the System event log showed `codex-command-runner ...
(0xc0000142)`. If you see that with an older build, update, or start Corbanu
Terminal from the console or Remote Desktop session instead.

Your organization's managed requirements may allow only the non-admin sandbox.
In that case the warning still appears so you know the limits.
