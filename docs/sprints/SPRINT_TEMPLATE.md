# PF-00-S00 — Mechanical deliverable

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: `<one concrete code outcome>`
- Excludes: `<adjacent feature work>`

## Plan linkage

- Plan: `<relative Markdown link to one concrete plan record>`
- Feature: `PF-00`
- Acceptance advanced: `<one exact plan acceptance>`

## Code boundaries

- Existing: `<path::symbol>`
- Planned: `<path::symbol or file>`
- Tests: `<test path>`

## Preconditions

- [ ] Plan is active.
- [ ] Dependencies are completed.
- [ ] Worktree, branch, and base commit are exact and match the plan.
- [ ] If parallel, owner/lane/scopes are disjoint and the receiving integration gate is recorded.

## Done

- [x] Sprint record created and linked to one plan feature.

## Remaining

- [ ] `<ordered implementation task>`
- [ ] `<regression task>`
- [ ] Code-blind functional design frozen before test-result disclosure, or non-user-facing N/A reason recorded.

## Verification

- [ ] Focused test: `<final-tree command>`
- [ ] Integration test: `<final-tree command>`
- [ ] TUI applicability resolved; if applicable, keys and checkpoints recorded.
- [ ] Code-blind cases independently executed under enforced isolation; schema-2 receipts, exact-package evidence and separate evidence check linked (or accepted internal-only N/A).

## Exit evidence

- [ ] Implementation commit recorded.
- [ ] Final-tree test output linked.
- [ ] Code-blind handoff checker passes, or explicit limited-testing agreement/blocker recorded; no automatic human acceptance.
- [ ] Parallel handoff, if applicable: commit, contract versions, scope audit and combined-tree test evidence recorded.
- [ ] `Done` and `Remaining` ledgers reflect reality.
- [ ] Completed record moved to `docs/sprints/archive/<plan-slug>/`.
