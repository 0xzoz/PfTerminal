# PF-64-S02 — Support and recovery rehearsal

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: docs/research/rollout-support/runbook.md; No blocker is assigned to an agent with authority it lacks; each failure ends in recovery or a named escalation.
- Excludes: Sending invitations, issuing subsidized Plans, posting marketing, collecting unconsented telemetry or announcing unfinished security.
- Budget proposal: 0.5–2 analyst-days after inputs are available; not a commitment. Stop and re-slice if the bound is exceeded.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Controlled rollout, support ownership and adoption](../../../plans/proposed/portfolio-rollout-support.md)
- Feature: `PF-64`; acceptance: No blocker is assigned to an agent with authority it lacks; each failure ends in recovery or a named escalation.
- Upstream/allocation: [plan record](../../../plans/proposed/portfolio-rollout-support.md#native-lifecycle-and-upstream-touch-record).

## Code boundaries

- Existing, read before work: `docs/features/tasknode.md`; `docs/features/wallet-plan.md`; `docs/features/model-providers.md`.
- Planned output: `docs/research/rollout-support/runbook.md`; no edits outside the allocated scope.
- Tests/evidence: `qa/portfolio/rollout-support/pf-64-s02/` (planned); final literal test/registration scope required before readiness.

## Preconditions

- [ ] Plan active after explicit authority decision; global WIP and occupied lanes reconciled.
- [ ] Dependencies completed and archived; Accepted PF-64-S01 output and its explicit go/no-go; no unresolved decision that changes this mandate.
- [ ] Exact worktree/branch/40-character base match plan; literal scopes and receiving owner are allocated.
- [ ] Inputs, disclosure rights and spend/time limits approved; external writes and live financial actions remain excluded.
- [ ] Resolve exact changed files, native compatibility and nonempty test commands before any code sprint starts.

## Done

- [x] Draft sprint created and linked to one feature; no implementation completed.

## Remaining

- [ ] Write first-line support scripts for login expiry, account confusion, outage, payments and abandoned sessions.
- [ ] Tabletop with one tester limited to documented controls and a separate fixture operator; record missing recovery paths.
- [ ] Define severity, escalation, response coverage and stop-enrollment thresholds; route defects to existing feature owners.
- [ ] Inventory the Corbanu API docs/page and owning repository; propose a docs owner, release/model-change update trigger and stale-doc escalation, without guessing external paths or publishing.
- [ ] Define example/auth/error/price/version checks for inference, deep research and new capabilities; PF-70 delivery retains responsibility for its own verified API docs.
- [ ] Record actual outputs, counterexamples, remaining limitations and a concrete next-sprint handoff; stop on changed scope.

## Verification

- [ ] Focused: Run the tabletop against at least five failure cases and retain the observed steps, not just a checklist.
- [ ] Integration: from repo root, `python3 docs/plans/check.py; python3 docs/sprints/check.py`; `git diff --check`.
- [ ] Independently inspect source provenance, calculations and the plan's success/failure/recovery table; document-only checks do not qualify product UI.
- [ ] Record reviewer, artifact digest, expected versus actual results and observed cases; identify automation as not applicable when none ran. Never invent a test count or pass.

## Exit evidence

- [ ] Output commit/digest and input provenance recorded; checks linked to that final artifact/tree.
- [ ] Named human/receiving owner accepts the bounded output; needed go/no-go decision is recorded.
- [ ] Handoff includes changed scope, contracts, known gaps and required combined-tree evidence.
- [ ] Done/Remaining ledgers updated honestly; archive accepted record under `docs/sprints/archive/portfolio-rollout-support/` and update plan backlinks.
