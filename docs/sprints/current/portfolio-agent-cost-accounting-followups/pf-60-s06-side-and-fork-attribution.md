# PF-60-S06 — Side-conversation and temporary-fork attribution

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: items (i) and (ii) from Travis's 2026-10-10 decision ([PF-60-S04 Closure](../../archive/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s04-cost-accounting-acceptance-and-handoff.md)).
  - (i) #400: a guardian review of a `/side` conversation, and a sub-agent started from one, are recorded. Today
    they are excluded because the side conversation itself isn't persisted.
  - (ii) #401: the `side:` label names only TUI `/side`. Every other kind of temporary fork of a saved conversation
    gets a label naming what it is.
- Excludes: price changes, `/cost` layout changes beyond the new labels, recording `exec --ephemeral` runs.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Accounting follow-ups after PF-60](../../../plans/active/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting-followups.md); feature `PF-60`.
- Acceptance advanced: every request appears once under the parent conversation, labelled with what it was.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: `codex-rs/core/src/session/mod.rs::accounting_owner` and `accounting_owner_elsewhere`;
  `codex-rs/core/src/accounting.rs` (`AccountingOwner`, turn labels); `codex-rs/core/src/guardian/review_session.rs`;
  sub-agent spawning under `codex-rs/core/src/agent/`.
- Planned: owner resolution that follows a temporary fork up to its persisted conversation; a label per fork kind.
- Tests: `codex-rs/core/src/accounting_extensions_tests.rs`, `codex-rs/core/tests/suite/accounting_responses.rs`;
  literal list fixed at readiness.

## Preconditions

- [x] Plan is active (Travis, 2026-10-14; slot 2).
- [x] Dependencies are completed (PF-60-S04 archived 2026-10-10).
- [x] Worktree, branch, and base commit are exact and match the plan.
- [x] Not parallel: the plan runs one sprint at a time.

## Done

- [x] Draft sprint created 2026-10-10 from Travis's decision; linked to one plan feature.
- [x] Allocated 2026-10-14 (worker `pf60-s06`) when Travis started the follow-ups.
- [x] Audit: [coverage audit](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s06/coverage-audit.md), listing every
      session with no thread of its own, its owner and its label.
- [x] AC1: a guardian review inside `/side` is recorded once under the saved conversation, as `side:review:`. Shown by
      a test, in a live tmux run and in the video.
- [x] AC2: a sub-agent from `/side` is recorded under the saved conversation, as `side:agent:`. The test checks exact
      rows and the day total. It wasn't shown live, because `/side` tells the model not to spawn agents (see the gate).
- [x] AC3: `side:` only for TUI `/side` (thread source `side`); every other temporary fork is `fork:`; sub-agents and
      `/review` tasks without a thread are `agent:` and `code-review:`.
- [x] AC4: the ledger format is unchanged; the labels are ordinary turn labels, so older rows read as before.
- [x] AC5: `exec --ephemeral`, and work done for it, stay excluded, with one log line per session (existing
      `an_uncollected_session_is_named_once` plus a new sub-agent guard).
- [x] Gate: [gate.md](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s06/gate.md); PR #793 at code head
      `604fe9c89d`; plan activation in #790.

## Remaining

- [ ] Code-blind functional design frozen before test-result disclosure (PF-60-S10).
- [ ] Travis accepts S06; #400 and #401 closed on acceptance.

## Verification

- [x] Focused `just test -p codex-core -E 'test(accounting) | test(guardian) | test(side) | test(spawn)'`: 523/523 with
      `developer-accounting`, 518/518 without; `codex-tui` `test(side)` 94/94.
- [x] macOS and Linux clippy `-D warnings --tests`, with and without `developer-accounting`.
- [x] TUI: tmux run with real keys (`/side` plus a guardian review), the ledger read back, and the
      [demo video](https://github.com/CorbanuCore/CorbanuTerminal/releases/download/demos/pf-60-s06-pf60s06-side-guardian-review-cost-604fe9c89da3-2026-10-14.mp4).
- [ ] Code-blind cases executed independently (in PF-60-S10 under the enforced gate).

## Exit evidence

- [x] Implementation commits recorded: `1bb8e8d834`, `604fe9c89d` (PR #793).
- [x] Final-tree test output linked (gate).
- [ ] Code-blind handoff checker passes, or explicit limited-testing agreement/blocker recorded; no automatic human acceptance.
- [ ] `Done` and `Remaining` ledgers reflect reality; #400 and #401 closed.
- [ ] Completed record moved to `docs/sprints/archive/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting-followups/`.
