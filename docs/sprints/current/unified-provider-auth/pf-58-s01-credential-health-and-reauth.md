# PF-58-S01 — Credential-scoped runtime health and keyboard reauthentication

September 11: Travis human-accepted PF13 and authorized main integration. Main defers this plan;
remaining qualification returns to draft, preserving implementation and the spent nine-review ledger.

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: trustworthy auth-health status and source-appropriate keyboard recovery for configured providers, including the reported OpenAI connected-app expiry.
- Excludes: automatic credential/account/billing fallback, new providers, cloud login on the user's behalf, privileged setup and release claims. User authorized catalog/current-label/health-refresh repairs September 10.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Unified provider auth](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-14-unified-provider-auth.md), feature PF-58.
- Product heading: **Shipping MVP — LIVE**; excerpt: “Encrypted `/vault`, masked entry, metadata-only inspection, and operational credential use without placing raw values in chat.”
- User authorized generalizing reauth on 2026-09-05 after the misleading Active label.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: login AuthManager metadata/refresh, model-provider auth, MCP transport startup classification, shared provider status/controller and TUI notification/selection adapters.
- Planned: typed credential-scoped failure/recovery metadata; thin TUI keyboard/status projection; reuse established recovery backends.
- Tests: synthetic status/refresh/classification and stale-result regressions, snapshots and typed TMUX.

## Preconditions

- [x] Active plan and completed archived PF-57 dependency verified.
- [x] Exact branch/worktree/base recorded; scope disjoint from frozen broker reservation.
- [x] RTX affected credential identified from metadata only; values never exposed.

## Done

- [x] Final signed picker package passes Mac/Linux TMUX and two unattended Mac existing-profile menu launches; human no-loop acceptance remains open.
- [x] Repair invented catalog/current markers and stale health, preserve custom routes; 58 TUI + 72 provider-auth regressions and 32 Linux integration tests pass. See `qa/provider-auth/pf-58/picker-repair-20260910.md`.
- [x] September 10 native Mac prompt budget installed without ACL/secret-cache changes.
  Eight focused tests, two native Keychain tests and Ctrl+C TMUX pass. That historical
  package fails Escape; superseded by the repair below. See `qa/provider-auth/pf-58/macos-keychain-20260910.md`.

- [x] User amendment/serial allocation recorded; working candidate unchanged and security monitor paused during that implementation.
- [x] Trace refresh failure and exact credential/service identity through transport and status projection.
- [x] Implement source-scoped auth health without treating network/429/generic403 as expired credentials or disabling unrelated providers.
- [x] Reuse existing account/API-key/source recovery from an advertised keyboard action; preserve cancel/current model and reject stale recovery.
- [x] Refresh status and reconnect the affected app service after successful account recovery without process restart (synthetic account/request and core MCP transport proof; live sign-in remains a human check).
- [x] Generalize managed, environment, command/AWS and local capability handling with truthful unsupported-action guidance.
- [x] Run final focused automated/TMUX matrix and five bounded reviews; findings corrected. The fifth correction is test-verified without a sixth review under the user cap. The later expanded qualification and native-child repair are documented separately.
- [x] Repair Claude recovery with missing source selection, retaining source/owner restrictions.
  Three Claude TMUX journeys and 71 provider-auth tests pass; adjacent runtime/child evidence:
  `qa/provider-auth/pf-58/product-repairs-20260908.md`.

- [x] Repair rejection/provider identity and clarify configured versus verified credentials.
  Strict 226 selected units and 32 Linux checks pass; packaged Escape passes on both platforms.
  Four Mac live launches replied with unchanged config. See `qa/provider-auth/pf-58/blind-repairs-20260910/`.
  Final Astra High evidence review (pass 8) supports targeted repairs, not full frozen-case readiness.

## Remaining
- [ ] Qualify remaining frozen cases with exact evidence; live/native prerequisites remain.
  Final pass 9 found two reporting issues, corrected without re-review; no tenth pass or waiver. Native Applications confirmation remains open.

- [ ] Qualify complete runtime and plugin launch environment before handoff; all 26 human checks
  require current-candidate evidence or a blocker. `qa/provider-auth/pf-58/handoff-readiness.md`
  distinguishes earlier auth-only passes from helper packaging/MCP dependency qualification.

## Verification
- [ ] Close residual frozen automated/native evidence gaps; human acceptance does not relabel prior blocked results.
- [x] Final Mac prompt-budget unit/native checks and explicitly Ctrl+C-based
  staged TMUX smoke recorded; Escape failures retained rather than waived.
- [x] Travis confirmed live messages and provider switching without Keychain prompts; PF13 human acceptance reaffirmed September 11. Historical failed native runs remain recorded.

- [x] Earlier staged TMUX 45/45, Fable request/shell and installed MCP inventory passed;
  `qa/provider-auth/pf-58/evidence/repairs-20260908/` preserves platform/live gaps.

- [x] Final scoped fix/fmt then affected provider-auth/login/MCP/TUI tests on RTX.
- [x] True-TMUX: account failure/recovery/cancel and API-key replacement; unit/snapshot coverage for unaffected providers, stale failures and narrow rendering. Final focused TMUX run: 6/6.
- [x] Credential canaries absent from status, snapshots, transcripts and errors.
- [x] Live-repository applicability recorded; human acceptance pending in checks 24–26.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Exact changed-source manifest/candidate hashes and final test/review reports linked under qa/provider-auth/pf-58.
- [x] Human guide updated without marking user checks accepted.
- [x] Both final packages pass 12 expanded journeys and trusted Apps recovery; 227 units, integration follow-up and eight Mac live replies recorded in `qa/provider-auth/pf-58/finish-20260910/`; shortcut retargeted.
- [x] Source `2545eedee` pushed to provider branch; subsequent integration recorded separately.
- [ ] Ledgers accurate and completed sprint archived only after required evidence.
