# Unified provider-auth execution sprints

The active [unified provider onboarding and management plan](../../../plans/active/unified-provider-auth.md)
reserves two PF-84 lanes. PF-42 through PF-47 are the merged Claude-auth
foundation. PF-48 through PF-57 are completed and archived; no implementation
sprint from that sequence remains open. PF-57-S02 also completed the user's
2026-09-04 Astra reconciliation repairs in its isolated serial worktree.
PF-57-S03 also completed and is archived: it reconciled those repairs with
Travis's two subsequent integration-branch commits under the user's 2026-09-05
mandate. PF-55-S02 is also completed and archived, adding the user's explicitly
requested OpenAI Astra selector option without changing defaults or delegation.
PF-55-S03 is completed and archived: the native Astra repair passed real TUI
inference/tool, cancel/recovery and same-thread resume in both default test
repositories, and the exact qualified binary is installed for human testing.
PF-55-S04 is completed and archived: exact Luna/Kimi K3 child launches, results
and cold resume pass in both live repositories. PF-58 is the current serial
credential-health and reauthentication follow-up.
PF-84 (named accounts per provider) was activated on 2026-10-10. Travis accepted
S01, S02 and S03 on 2026-10-11 and they are archived: S02 and S03 behind the
default-off `named_accounts` flag, S03 with limits (#425, #426 and #428 must be
resolved before the flag is removed; S02-15 stays open). S04 is in progress; S05 follows. S06 (named AWS profile, then
ChatGPT/OpenAI sign-in accounts) follows S05 per Travis's 2026-10-11 decision
D4. See the plan's PF-84 section.

## Delivery contract

- PF-48 through PF-56 implementation owner: GPT-5.6 Sol high implementation agent.
- PF-57 integration and feature-completeness owner: Codex primary integration agent.
- PF-57 preserved archived commit identities by merging rather than rebasing.
- Its recorded review exception completed with Fable 5.1 through Corbanu and
  TMUX after all applicable integration findings were repaired.
- True-TMUX qualification from PF-56 passed on combined candidate `a935e507b`.
