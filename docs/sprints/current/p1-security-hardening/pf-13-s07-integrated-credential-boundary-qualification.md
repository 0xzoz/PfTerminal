# PF-13-S07 — Integrated credential boundary qualification

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: final-tree canary and adversarial evidence for the complete credential boundary after the component repair sprint and all isolation/output/migration/connection controls.
- Excludes: new credential behavior, additional providers, release-level TUI/live-repository qualification and finished documentation.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P1 security hardening](../../../plans/active/p1-security-hardening.md#carried-forward-from-p0), carried forward
  from the [closed P0 plan](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md) on 2026-10-08 (Travis).
- Feature: `PF-13`.
- Product citation: **Required trust boundaries** — “Credentials are referenced by label and resolved only inside a trusted execution boundary.”
- Acceptance advanced: component evidence from PF-13-S05 remains valid for its exact candidate, but cannot qualify the later integrated protected boundary.

## Code boundaries

- Inputs: archived PF-13-S01–S04, PF-13-S05 repair evidence, PF-13-S06 usage reservations and completed PF-27/28/29/33 controls.
- Harness/evidence: `scripts/security-credential-canary`; `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-13-S07/`.
- No runtime edits; failures return to the owning sprint before rerunning this qualification.

## Preconditions

- [x] Plan active (P1, 2026-10-08); every dependency completed and archived.
- [ ] Allocate exact worktree/branch/base and independent reviewer against one frozen integrated candidate.
- [ ] Read root and applicable Rust/test-TUI instructions; validate sprint graph before readiness.

## Done

- [x] Final integration gate separated from the in-progress component repair record; no historical pass is relabeled.
- [x] Address issue #239 when Aggressive/Moderate read sandboxing ships — fixed in PR #244 (merged); confirmed by the saved-level route matrix (round 5, 0 leaks under saved Aggressive and Moderate on macOS and Linux).
- [x] Aggressive milestone: isolated code-blind VM runs done (2026-10-10 to 2026-10-15; last record PR #868) and
  **signed off by Travis on 2026-10-16** (not this sprint; see the plan's
  [Aggressive ships row](../../../plans/active/p1-security-hardening.md#carried-forward-from-p0)).

## Gate record (2026-10-07)

- Candidate: `corbanu 0.1.48`, SHA-256 `1a123a79c4f9a81e6da5621b19907d3b9b6be0ae171a287662a31ff0221141c`, commit `64137b71894`.
- Canary harness: macOS 9/9 probes passed (0 leaks); Linux 9/9 probes passed (0 leaks, prior candidate).
- Direct sandbox probes: 7/8 blocked, 1 expected leak (files route, issue #239).
- Route matrix: supplementary agent-mediated evidence (model non-deterministic).
- Composition test: pass (no crash/deadlock with all flags on).
- Tmux adversarial: GLM 5.2 refused all routes (model refusals, not protection denials).
- Demo videos: composition-hello (23s), env-stripping (24s) — published.
- Independent review: claude-opus-5-5-plan, read-only; CHANGES REQUIRED → addressed (direct probes added, README fixed, route matrix documented as supplementary).
- Issue #239: workspace-write allows full disk read (known limitation; read protection requires Aggressive/Moderate level).
- Tests: `cargo test -p codex-security-policy -p codex-vault` (59 passed), `cargo test -p codex-core --lib credential` (29 passed), `cargo test -p codex-cli --test vault` (4 passed), `cargo test -p codex-process-hardening` (6 passed).

### Gate record (2026-10-07, round 5 — saved-level route matrix, issue #239 follow-up)

- Candidate: `corbanu 0.1.48`, source commit `a230f2082141d0fc4f4c2095b8349b1c0ed02f87` (origin/main tip, includes PR #244 / issue #239 fix).
  - macOS arm64 debug build, SHA-256 `9381f7359f9444e7931e6b912acbd1694f5d6ff673608928efac7d8d6ef9e547`.
  - Linux x86_64 debug build (RTX box `rtx-006`), SHA-256 `8929918ea13dd2a0cdc865c3b92376db419424c0e202e16babefd19f3ae2ac0d`.
- Saved-level route matrix v5: SAVED Aggressive and SAVED Moderate on macOS and Linux. 11 blocked, 0 leaked, 1 not contained (mcp_hook, unsandboxed by design), 1 known gap (claude_pane) on every run (corrected from 10 on 2026-10-08, matching the evidence README after PR #266). The #239 fix is confirmed by the sandbox in 3 of 4 runs: `$HOME/.ssh` reads are denied ("Operation not permitted") under saved Aggressive and Moderate on macOS and saved Aggressive on Linux; in the Linux Moderate run the model declined to run the command. Evidence: `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-13-S07/evidence/route-matrix-v5-*.json`.
- Independent review: claude-opus-5-5-plan (claude-plan), read-only, on the new evidence — see below.

## Remaining

- [ ] Re-run Linux canary harness on the current candidate when the RTX box is accessible (prior run used commit `e72563e5f7`).

## Verification

- [x] Fix/format owning crates before freezing the candidate; run final affected policy, Vault, proxy and Core suites without filtering failures.
- [x] Run the canary harness on all promised platforms with candidate/source identity and complete-output scans.
- [x] Full isolated code-blind VM run (milestone only): Aggressive ships, signed off 2026-10-16.
- [ ] Linux canary harness re-run on the current candidate (Remaining).
- [x] TUI applicability: component-only here; PF-26-S02 retains the integrated true-TUI and live-repository workflows.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Record candidate, commands, platform results, reviewer and artifact/source hashes under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-13-S07/`.
- [x] No S01–S05 evidence is relabeled as proof of S06 or composed downstream controls.
- [ ] Archive once the Linux canary is re-run (the Aggressive milestone sign-off it waited for came on 2026-10-16).
