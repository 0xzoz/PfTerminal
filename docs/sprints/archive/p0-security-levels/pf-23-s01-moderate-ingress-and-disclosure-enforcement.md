# PF-23-S01 — Moderate ingress and disclosure enforcement

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: Moderate deterministically blocks untrusted requests for secrets, protected financial data, policy changes, or protected actions.
- Excludes: Aggressive defaults, financial signing implementation, classifier training, TUI, and browser isolation.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 `/security` levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md)
- Feature: `PF-23`
- Reconciliation: [source decisions and archive mapping](../../../plans/security-source-reconciliation.md).
- Product citation: **P0 `/security` levels** — “Existing approval, sandbox, vault, wallet, tool, network, and agent policies are unchanged.”
- Acceptance advanced: normal analysis continues while hostile instructions cannot gain authority or protected data.

## Code boundaries

- Slice 1: `core/src/security/protected_surface.rs`, `protected_surface/{gate,typed}.rs`, dispatch call in
  `tools/registry.rs`; routes in `mcp_tool_call.rs`, `handlers/unified_exec/write_stdin.rs`, `code_mode/mod.rs`;
  shell kinds `Disclosure`/`ValueTransfer` in `security/tainted_action/outbound.rs`.
- Slice 2: `core/src/memory_stage_one.rs` (`label_rollout`), `memories/write/src/{phase1,runtime,start}.rs`.
- Slice 3: `core/src/security/protected_surface/read_denials.rs`, applied in `core/src/tools/orchestrator.rs`.
- Tests: `protected_surface_tests.rs`, `tainted_action_tests.rs`, `read_denials_tests.rs`,
  `memory_stage_one_tests.rs`, `memories/write/src/startup_tests.rs`, `core/tests/suite/pf_23_s01.rs`.

## Split with PF-29

Slice 3 is the runtime net: after untrusted content under Moderate/Aggressive, Core adds read denials to each
agent command's sandbox (Corbanu home, other Corbanu homes, fixed `$HOME` credentials such as `~/.ssh`). PF-29
owns launch and user data: S01 inventory and launch isolation (every credential file found, from launch), S02
migration of secrets out of shell profiles and config. Slice 3 never denies shell profiles; no shared files.
Also recorded in [PF-29-S02](../../archive/p0-security-levels/pf-29-s02-human-secret-migration.md#split-with-pf-23-s01-2026-10-06).

## Preconditions

- [x] PF-13-S05, PF-22-S02, PF-30-S03 are completed and archived.
- [x] Read root, `codex-rs/AGENTS.md`, and `codex-rs/core/AGENTS.md`; coordinates match the active plan.

## Done

All behind `source_envelopes` with Moderate/Aggressive; flag off, Permissive and untainted sessions unchanged.

- [x] Slice 1, #223 ([gate](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-23-S01/slice-1-gate.md)): route matrix at the
  dispatch boundary (unclassified tools need a fresh human answer after taint); MCP calls that may change/send
  data, move value or name a protected path ask before remembered approvals, hooks and auto-review; typing into a
  process is judged as one command since taint; code-mode nested results raise the taint generation;
  Disclosure and value-transfer kinds; decisions logged without arguments.
- [x] Slice 2: stage one under Moderate. Core reads the claimed session's rollout (its opening record must be
  that session's), redacts each item, restores only origin records this home signed, labels the rest, drops whole
  items from the middle to fit the budget, and builds the message; the host gives only its redaction function and
  prompt template. The request must be exactly that message or it is refused before dispatch, also mid-job.
  Aggressive, and Moderate without the flag, deny; consolidation is skipped above Permissive.
- [x] Slice 3: after taint, agent command sandboxes, in-process file tools (patch pre-check, edits, image view,
  extension tools) and Codex Apps uploads deny reads of the Corbanu home (all but `tmp`, `shell_snapshots`, skills,
  plugins, packages, worktrees, `AGENTS.md`; fixed stores and `*.sqlite*` even before they exist), other Corbanu
  homes and `$HOME` credentials. Only the turn's folder, workspace and writable roots stay readable, never a
  command's own folder. Full access gets a sandbox that only denies those reads; no unsandboxed retries. Under
  Moderate a fresh human approval of the exact protected shell/exec command lifts them for that run (never for
  file tools). [Readiness matrix](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-23-S01/activation-readiness.md).

## Remaining

Nothing in this sprint. Moved: Aggressive grants lifting denials, write/action gaps of the command-text net,
processes started before untrusted content, and the Codex Apps upload check-then-read race (read through the
protected sandbox before the flag is turned on) to [PF-23-S02](pf-23-s02-aggressive-deny-and-grant-enforcement.md);
consolidation, Aggressive stage one and the level a source session ran under to
[PF-23-S03](../../current/p0-security-levels/pf-23-s03-downgrade-restart-and-inheritance-enforcement.md).
Known limits and product findings: [slices 2-3 gate](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-23-S01/slices-2-3-gate.md#known-limits-moved-or-open).

## Verification

- [x] Per slice: `just fix -p codex-core -p codex-memories-write`, `just fmt`, focused `pf_23_s01`,
  `memory_stage_one`, `pf_30_s0`, `just test -p codex-memories-write`, full `just test -p codex-core`, Linux clippy
  on the RTX box, GLM 5.2 videos, Opus 5.5 High review (slices 2-3: three rounds, APPROVE).

## Exit evidence

- [x] Gates under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-23-S01/` ([slice 1](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-23-S01/slice-1-gate.md),
  [slices 2-3](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-23-S01/slices-2-3-gate.md)); videos in
  [qa/demos/index/PF-23-S01.md](../../../../qa/demos/index/PF-23-S01.md); record archived.
