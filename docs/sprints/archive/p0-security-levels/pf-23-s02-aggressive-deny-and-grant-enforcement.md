# PF-23-S02 — Aggressive deny and grant enforcement

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: Aggressive denies every named sensitive surface unless one matching human grant is active.
- Excludes: grant TUI, signing adapters, new tools/providers, downgrade flow, and qualification.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 `/security` levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md)
- Feature: `PF-23`
- Reconciliation: [source decisions and archive mapping](../../../plans/security-source-reconciliation.md).
- Product citation: **P0 `/security` levels** — “Existing approval, sandbox, vault, wallet, tool, network, and agent policies are unchanged.”
- Acceptance advanced: one narrow grant cannot authorize an adjacent actor, resource, destination, operation, child, or post-expiry use.

## Code boundaries

- `core/src/security/aggressive.rs`: the one grant enforcement point (`issue` host-only, `admit`, `revoke_all`).
- `core/src/security/protected_surface/read_denials.rs`: protected-path rules (reads denied, persistence read-only).
- `core/src/security/protected_surface/confined.rs`: which processes started inside the rules, recorded at spawn
  in `tools/runtimes/unified_exec.rs` (`write_stdin`).
- `core/src/tools/orchestrator.rs` (lift by Moderate approval or Aggressive grant), `core/src/mcp_openai_file.rs`
  (sandboxed upload reads), `sandboxing/src/seatbelt.rs` (rename guard), `tainted_action/{paths,shell}.rs` (Persistence).

## Preconditions

- [x] PF-17-S01 and PF-23-S01 are completed and archived.
- [x] Read root, `codex-rs/AGENTS.md`, and `codex-rs/core/AGENTS.md`; worktree recorded above.

## Done

All behind `source_envelopes` with Moderate/Aggressive; flag off and Permissive unchanged.
Gate: [qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-23-S02/gate.md](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-23-S02/gate.md).

- [x] Aggressive applies the protected-path rules from the session start; an approval never lifts them, only a
  `BoundedGrant` matching lineage, surface, exact operation, session, expiry, uses and policy epoch. Another level,
  the kill switch or no live policy drops every grant; grants are never inherited (a child has its own lineage and
  session; derived grants keep the parent's context and are refused).
- [x] The rules also make persistence files read-only (shell start-up, login items, `~/.local/bin`, `~/.claude`,
  hooks/config/commondir of the enclosing repository and its `.git` file, project `.codex`/`.agents`, Corbanu home
  entries that stay readable), only where the profile allowed writes; profile denials stay. macOS denies renaming
  or removing any folder above a protected path or a protected link, and creating a missing parent of one.
- [x] Command-text net: writes, moves and removals of those paths, of folders above them and of anything below
  `.git` but objects/refs/index (and `git config` run keys, cron, launchd, `systemctl --user`) are a new
  Persistence kind.
- [x] Codex Apps uploads read through the protected sandbox (moved from PF-23-S01); no sandbox, no upload.
- [x] A process started without the rules is recorded at spawn; typing into it after untrusted content asks once
  per start under Moderate and needs a grant under Aggressive (moved from PF-23-S01).

## Remaining

Nothing in this sprint. Grant issuance UI is PF-25-S01 (`aggressive::issue`, `confined::grant_operation`);
revocation UI PF-25-S02. Broker, retrieval, browser-login and derived-data adapters do not exist yet and must call
`aggressive::admit` when built. Known limits (Linux renames and missing home files, submodules, `core.hooksPath`)
are in the [gate record](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-23-S02/gate.md#known-limits).

## Verification

- [x] `just fix -p codex-core`, `just fmt`, focused `just test -p codex-core pf_23_s02 pf_23_s01 pf_30_s03
  mcp_openai_file aggressive confined`, `just test -p codex-sandboxing`, full `just test -p codex-core`.
- [x] Linux clippy (`-D warnings`) on the RTX box; four GLM 5.2 videos; Opus 5.5 High review (five rounds, APPROVE).

## Exit evidence

- [x] Denied-surface matrix and results in the [gate record](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-23-S02/gate.md);
  videos in [qa/demos/index/PF-23-S02.md](../../../../qa/demos/index/PF-23-S02.md); record archived.
