# PF-82-S01 — Team Context terminal parity

Identity reconciliation, September 11: released as PF-76-S01 at `5f3a0ad7d`.
Renamed mechanically to PF-82-S01 to avoid main's pre-existing PF-76 profile
persistence record. Original implementation and qualification are unchanged.

## Execution mandate

Expose the existing authorized Team Context report through a read-only terminal bridge, `tasknode team context --json`, and `/tasknode team` with a menu entry. Preserve profile scope and grant checks. No private-doc sharing, permission changes, inference changes or release replacement.

## Plan linkage

[Active plan PF-82](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md#pf-82--team-context-terminal-parity).

## Code boundaries

CLI tasknode_cmd.rs, TUI tasknode_menu child module and event/slash adapters, server tasknode-terminal-routes.js and route-policies.js. New route smoke and typed report snapshot tests.

## Preconditions

- [x] Active plan, no unfinished dependencies, exact worktree and disjoint allocation checked.

## Done

- [x] User authority, active plan, independent scope and exact worktree recorded.


- [x] Add the bridge using the existing collaboration route and authenticated terminal account.
- [x] Add CLI and TUI report access, explicit states and refresh.
- [x] Verify auth, grant revocation, CLI JSON, TUI snapshots and scope rejection.
- [x] Run final formatting, tests, build and keyboard workflows in both default disposable repositories.
- [x] Deploy the server route and verify `corbanu-debug --yolo`; update docs and evidence.


## Remaining

None.

## Verification

- [x] Backend route and Team Context smoke; `just test -p codex-cli` focused helper tests; `just test -p codex-tui` focused tasknode tests. Final true PTY on the candidate, including failure/recovery, cancellation and restart.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Record source commits, exact commands, live backend evidence, installed binary digest, PTY keys/screens and any remaining limitations in `qa/reliability/team-context-2026-09-11/`. Archive after all Remaining items are verified.

Implementation: `721d6f974d`; server `39e051c`, live release 737. [Final evidence](../../../../qa/reliability/team-context-2026-09-11/README.md) includes 24 Rust tests, backend permission checks and true PTY workflows in both default repositories.
