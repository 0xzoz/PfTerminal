# PF-22-S02 — Protected runtime integration and upstream seams

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: Integrate new protected state, dispatch fences and durable events through small audited Core hooks.
- Excludes: individual ingress/egress adapters, broker implementation, TUI and release qualification.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 security levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md).
- Feature: `PF-22`.
- Product citation: **Reconciled security scope — TO BUILD** — “Unknown or unsupported protected paths fail visibly rather than falling back to raw secrets or unscreened execution.”
- Acceptance advanced: [architecture refinements](../../../plans/security-architecture-refinements-2026-08-28.md); preserve the completed S01 and its historical evidence, with only added guarantees in this follow-up.

## Code boundaries

- OpenClaw adoption: OC-8 in the [pinned source review](../../../plans/openclaw-source-review-2026-08-28.md), commit `13adff02ca3897768d80d2bca18f5acf08c55d91`; named source tests are references, not candidate passes.

- Existing: `codex-rs/core/src/security/{mod,effective_policy}.rs`, sibling tests, config/session and `agent/{control,registry}.rs` integration hooks.
- Planned: `qa/security-levels/upstream-seams.json`, `scripts/security-upstream-seams-check`, `scripts/tests/test_security_upstream_seams.py`.
- Use existing policy/inheritance types; adapter-owning sprints extend the seam register and their own tests.

## Preconditions

- [x] Plan active; all dependencies completed and archived.
- [x] Assigned a named execution owner and exact plan-matching worktree/branch/base with a disjoint scope and integration gate.
- [x] Read root and nearest implementation AGENTS.md; run the sprint checker before readiness.

## Done

- [x] Follow-up separated from the accepted upstream foundation; no new implementation or qualification claimed.
- [x] Composed PF-19 dispatch/revocation fences, PF-20 authoritative state and PF-41 durable intent/terminal recovery into one fail-closed protected-runtime contract.
- [x] Bound configured, creator-required and effective containment plus owner/policy/run/revocation generations, measured readiness, expiry and recovery status without adding an adapter activation path.
- [x] Added an exact-symbol upstream seam register and mechanical checker; unverified adapter-owned seams remain explicitly pending.
- [x] Bound grant and mandate authority to the exact durable request/approved preview, with negative cross-request substitution coverage.
- [x] Remediated the first Opus review: trusted live dispatch time, durable mandate one-shot enforcement, bounded readiness, re-derived effective containment, explicit dispatch resolution and exact repository-contained seam evidence.
- [x] Remediated the first Opus rereview: preview-stable mandate replay, conservative never-admitted closure, internally derived event context, immutable/monotonic readiness, actor/request binding, available recovery-checkpoint binding and correct Rust char-literal lexing.
- [x] Remediated the next Opus pass: domain-separated grant/mandate deduplication, opaque per-runtime dispatch identity, and an explicit conservative Unknown-only mandate closure where durable admission proof does not exist.
- [x] Remediated the final-pass retry finding under integration-owner-authorized audit scope: journal resolution borrows the non-clone permit, Core retains one exact pending outcome only across known non-ambiguous errors, and commit-unknown disables direct retry.
- [x] Remediated the ship-pass lifecycle finding: authorization now requires a live permit and no pending resolution before any validation, fence transition or effect, with negative coverage for every successful terminal path and retry-pending state.
- [x] Recorded focused, affected, compatibility and real-TMUX evidence under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-22-S02/`.
- [x] Integration owner merged the clean handback at `d74b2f77e6dc712ce8d89572594ceddac908365e`, reran the complete affected/seam/governance matrix and the 36-case compatibility harness, and captured an exact-binary real-TMUX `/status`/`/exit` smoke.

## Remaining

- [x] Recorded the PF-23/PF-24 consumer obligation to bind runtime readiness and journal recovery to one authenticated live run-generation source and prove a mismatch fails closed; that adapter work is not claimed by this foundation sprint.
- [x] Recorded a future cross-crate durable-admission or non-forgeable fence-to-audit proof before supporting receiptless never-admitted mandate Denied/Cancelled outcomes; PF-22 deliberately closes only as conservative Unknown.
- [x] Integration owner reran combined-tree gates, archived the sprint and updated shared plan/navigation ledgers.

## Verification

- [x] `cd codex-rs && just fix -p codex-core && just fmt` before final affected tests.
- [x] `cd codex-rs && just test -p codex-core effective_policy && just test -p codex-core security_inheritance` plus focused new integration cases.
- [x] `python3 scripts/security-upstream-seams-check --manifest qa/security-levels/upstream-seams.json` and `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p 'test_security_upstream_seams.py'`; missing hook/owner/commit/command/evidence must fail.
- [x] TUI applicability: no new UI here; PF-24/PF-25/PF-26 retain transition, stop and resume proof. The exact merged binary passed a supporting 200x60 real-TMUX `/status` and clean `/exit` smoke with read-only/never permissions.
- [x] Run the first required read-only Claude Opus 5 Max review through Corbanu Terminal in TMUX; it returned no P0, two P1 and six P2 findings, all dispositioned in evidence.
- [x] Rerun Opus 5 Max on the first P1/P2-remediated candidate; it returned no P0, two P1 and five P2 findings, all remediated and dispositioned in evidence.
- [x] Rerun Opus 5 Max on the second remediated candidate; it returned no P0/P1 and three P2 findings, with two safely remediated and one narrowed to an explicit future contract dependency.
- [x] Rerun Opus 5 Max on the third remediated candidate; it verified all prior fixes and returned one P2 retry-safety finding, remediated under the authorized audit scope.
- [x] Rerun Opus 5 Max on the fourth remediated candidate; it verified retry safety and returned one P2 effect-after-terminal lifecycle finding, now remediated.
- [x] Run the final focused Opus 5 Max review on the five-times-remediated candidate; verdict: `NO ACTIONABLE P0/P1/P2 FINDINGS`.
- [x] Reran the complete combined-tree affected matrix and PF-21 compatibility harness: 36/36 controls passed with a clean candidate tree. PF-23/PF-24 must repeat the relevant proof when their authenticated adapter provenance lands.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Record implementation/remediation commits, changed paths, contract versions and exact final-tree commands/results under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-22-S02/`.
- [x] Preserve S01 archive/evidence unchanged; do not relabel historical passes as proof of these new cases.
- [x] Record the consumer integration handoff and pending adapter owners in evidence.
- [x] Completed the integration-owner combined-tree matrix and shared ledgers before archive; authenticated run-generation adapter proof remains explicitly owned by PF-23/PF-24 and is not misreported as PF-22 behavior.
