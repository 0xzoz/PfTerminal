# PF-33-S02 — Connection pinning and alternate-egress denial

**October 6:** merged (PR #215) behind `url_destination_policy` (default off; Permissive unchanged).
[Evidence, platform matrix and review](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-33-S02/README.md). Returned to `draft`
to free the TUI lane: the remaining items belong to the broker lane, a future SearXNG adapter and PF-25-S02.

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: An agent cannot bypass policy by changing transport, resolution, proxy or local socket.
- Excludes: adjacent feature implementation, Permissive policy changes, and unlisted integrations.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 `/security` levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md#pf-33).
- Feature: `PF-33`.
- Product citation: **Non-negotiable controls** — “Default to no secret export, arbitrary egress, clipboard exposure, or sensitive logging.”
- Acceptance advanced: An agent cannot bypass policy by changing transport, resolution, proxy or local socket.
- Sources and archive disposition: [PF-33 reconciliation](../../../plans/security-source-reconciliation.md#pf-33).

## Code boundaries

- OpenClaw adoption reference: [OC-2](../../../plans/openclaw-source-review-2026-08-28.md#oc-2), [OC-9](../../../plans/openclaw-source-review-2026-08-28.md#oc-9) at `13adff02ca3897768d80d2bca18f5acf08c55d91`; see the review for named functions, callers, tests and limits. Reference tests are not candidate evidence.

- Existing/foundation: codex-rs/network-proxy/src/policy.rs; codex-rs/sandboxing/src/{manager,spawn}.rs.
- Planned: codex-rs/network-proxy/src/connection_policy.rs; codex-rs/secret-broker/tests/egress.rs.
- Tests: planned colocated Rust test modules prefixed `pf_33_s02`; fixtures use synthetic secrets and fake services only.

## Preconditions

- [x] Active plan. PF-33-S01 merged behind `url_destination_policy` (#210, #213) with gate evidence but is not
  archived; the coordinator let S02 start anyway (2026-10-06, PF-28-S01 precedent). The checker accepts a current
  dependency with `merged_behind_flag` and an existing `gate_evidence` file (`docs/sprints/check.py`, tested).
- [x] Read root and nearest implementation-path AGENTS.md; plan/worktree coordinates recorded; both checkers pass.
- [x] Reuses `url_destination_policy` (same feature, same proxy). Pinning lives in `connect_policy.rs` instead of a new
  `connection_policy.rs` so `lib.rs` (PF-27-S02 scope) is untouched. `secret-broker` is broker-lane scope: no
  `secret-broker/tests/egress.rs` here.

## Done

- [x] New single-feature record reconciled with current ownership and archived design input.
- [x] Pinning (`connect_policy.rs`, `destination.rs`, `mitm.rs`): each guarded request carries the checked answers;
  the connector dials only those, for that exact host/port, never re-resolving; no pin or another authority is
  refused; each address still passes the peer check; TLS identity still verified; every request dials fresh.
- [x] Alternate egress: inherited upstream proxies refused (`upstream_proxy`); the proxy's `x-unix-socket` route
  refused (`unix_socket`); a host denied after CONNECT is refused on the open tunnel (`host_denied`).
- [x] OS backend: the guard drops `allow_local_binding` and Unix-socket grants (`proxy.rs`, Windows provisioning in
  `network_proxy_spec.rs`), so Seatbelt allows only the proxy ports (no loopback services, raw DNS, Unix sockets).
  Linux proxy-routed mode (netns, seccomp AF_UNIX deny) unchanged. Matrix in the evidence README.
- [x] Real transport fixtures: loopback TCP/TLS with unresolvable `.invalid` names prove the pinned peer is used;
  fallback stays inside the checked answers; TLS mismatch fails; aborting one request leaves its sibling working.
- [x] Brokered credential routes are pinned too: placed in PF-28-S02 (broker lane) and done there (PR #225); the
  checked answers travel in the signed broker frame and the broker dials only those.
- [x] 15 `pf_33_s02` network-proxy tests, 1 sandboxing (Seatbelt), 1 core (Windows provisioning). No Cargo or
  lockfile change.

## Remaining

Nothing left in this sprint: merged behind its flag and archived when Travis closed the P0 plan on 2026-10-08. These open items moved to the [P1 plan](../../../plans/active/p1-security-hardening.md#carried-forward-from-p0):

- SearXNG: no adapter exists in the tree; route it through an exact private-service grant when one is added.
- Runtime-approved (decider) hosts are not revoked on an open tunnel (PF-25-S02). No live rebinding-resolver
  fixture; rebinding is covered by pinning tests.

## Verification

- [x] `just fix -p codex-network-proxy`, `-p codex-sandboxing`, `-p codex-core`; `just fmt`; final diff inspected.
- [x] Focused: `cargo test -p codex-network-proxy pf_33_s02` (15), `-p codex-sandboxing pf_33_s02` (1),
  `-p codex-core --lib pf_33_s02` (1). `codex-secret-broker` is broker scope: no test there.
- [x] Integration: `just test -p codex-network-proxy` (296 passed); `just test -p codex-sandboxing` (79 passed, 2
  failing identically on the base commit: temp-dir writable roots, unrelated); core `windows_sandbox`/`network_proxy`.
- [x] GLM 5.2 tmux runs as five SOP videos ([index](../../../../qa/demos/index/PF-33-S02.md)); Opus 5.5 High review
  APPROVE WITH NITS, dispositions in the [evidence README](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-33-S02/README.md).
- [x] PR CI green; merged behind `url_destination_policy` as PR #215 (`a0d96aea4b`).
- Moved to P1: PF-26 final-candidate requalification (milestone gate).

## Exit evidence

- [x] Commits, commands, outcomes and review record under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-33-S02/`.
- Moved to P1: PF-26 final-candidate and both-live-repository requalification remains mandatory; no release-complete claim here.
- [x] Ledgers reflect reality; open items moved to the [P1 plan](../../../plans/active/p1-security-hardening.md#carried-forward-from-p0) and the record archived with the P0 close (Travis, 2026-10-08).
