# PF-29-S02 — Human-reviewed credential migration and recovery

**October 6:** merged (PR #235, `65d42158d7`) behind `protected_mode_preflight`; returned to `draft` for its open items.

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: Migration is explicit, encrypted, recoverable and re-audited before Moderate/Aggressive becomes active.
- Excludes: adjacent feature implementation, Permissive policy changes, and unlisted integrations.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 `/security` levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md#pf-29).
- Feature: `PF-29`.
- Product citation: **Non-negotiable controls** — “Permit agents to reference credentials only by label; resolve them solely inside the trusted execution boundary.”
- Acceptance advanced: Migration is explicit, encrypted, recoverable and re-audited before Moderate/Aggressive becomes active.
- Sources and archive disposition: [PF-29 reconciliation](../../../plans/security-source-reconciliation.md#pf-29).

## Code boundaries

- OpenClaw adoption reference: [OC-6](../../../plans/openclaw-source-review-2026-08-28.md#oc-6) at `13adff02ca3897768d80d2bca18f5acf08c55d91`; see the review for named functions, callers, tests and limits. Reference tests are not candidate evidence.

- Core: `core/src/security/migration.rs` (plan, journal, run, recover), exported as `protected_preflight::migration`.
- TUI: `tui/src/security/migration.rs` (vault store, debug-only failure hook); screens in
  `bottom_pane/security_migration.rs` and the `/security` picker (PF-29-S01).
- Flag: `protected_mode_preflight` (PF-29-S01). Tests: `pf_29_s02` in codex-core (6) and codex-tui (4).

## Preconditions

- [x] Active plan; PF-24-S01 archived. PF-29-S01 merged behind `protected_mode_preflight` (#228) with gate evidence,
  not archived; started on that basis (PF-28-S01 precedent), same lane and worktree lineage.
- [x] Read root and nearest AGENTS.md; coordinates recorded above and in the plan.
- [x] Module paths as planned. Migration is offered from the Aggressive review; Moderate is not offered yet.

## Done

- [x] New single-feature record reconciled with current ownership and archived design input.
- [x] Preview (`m` in a blocked Aggressive review): source IDs and locations, vault labels, the reference each line
  becomes, owner-only access, restart, unsupported items with what to do, rotation. No values. Esc changes nothing.
- [x] Confirm rechecks the reviewed preflight; any drift moves nothing. Values go to the encrypted vault first
  (`ManualSecret`, existing labels never replaced), then each line is replaced atomically by
  `"$(corbanu vault auth-helper LABEL)"` (fish: `(…)`), `0600`, synced. No plaintext backup or rollback copy.
- [x] Journal `security_migration.toml`: created exclusively (one owner), labels and stages only, generation per
  write. A line is rewritten only while it still holds the stored value; an unstored entry is skipped if its file
  changed after confirmation, so a later owner is never overwritten. Linked profiles are not rewritten.
- [x] Interruption at any stage (prepared, stored, rewritten, committed; store failure) keeps the level, reports
  "Migration stopped" and locks Aggressive (preflight readiness) until `r` recovers. Recovery only rolls forward,
  converges on the uninterrupted result, never restores plain text and never writes the level.
- [x] After a move or recovery the review reruns the preflight (re-audit) before Aggressive can be saved; saving
  resets activation, so earlier conversations stay unresumable (PF-29-S01). Rotation is listed; nothing is rotated.

## Remaining

Nothing left in this sprint: merged behind its flag and archived when Travis closed the P0 plan on 2026-10-08. These open items moved to the [P1 plan](../../../plans/active/p1-security-hardening.md#carried-forward-from-p0):

- Only shell-profile exports are migrated; config literals, env variables and memories are listed with actions.
- Broker leases and other live capabilities are not revoked on migration (restart covers this session).

## Verification

- [x] `just fix -p codex-core -p codex-tui`, `just fmt`; final diff inspected.
- [x] Focused `pf_29_s02`: core 6, tui 4 (with the PF-29-S01 tests: core 20, tui 12).
- [x] Suites, three GLM 5.2 videos, Opus review (changes, then approved); CI green; merged as #235 ([evidence](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-29-S02/README.md)).
- Moved to P1: PF-26 final-candidate requalification (milestone gate).

## Exit evidence

- [x] Commits, commands, outcomes, videos and review under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-29-S02/`.
- Moved to P1: PF-26 final-candidate and both-live-repository requalification remains mandatory; no release-complete claim here.
- [x] Ledgers reflect reality; open items moved to the [P1 plan](../../../plans/active/p1-security-hardening.md#carried-forward-from-p0) and the record archived with the P0 close (Travis, 2026-10-08).

## Split with PF-23-S01 (2026-10-06)

PF-23-S01 slice 3 (archived; `core/src/security/protected_surface/read_denials.rs`, `core/src/tools/orchestrator.rs`)
denies, at runtime after untrusted content, reads of the Corbanu home and fixed `$HOME` credentials such as `~/.ssh`.
PF-29 keeps launch inventory/isolation (S01) and moving secrets out of shell profiles and config (S02); no shared files.
