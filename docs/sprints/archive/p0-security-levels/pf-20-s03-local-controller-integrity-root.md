# PF-20-S03 — Local controller integrity root

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: a Linux local-controller durable checkpoint implementation and narrow adapters to existing policy/audit anchor contracts, protecting against restored agent-accessible data.
- Excludes: whole-machine snapshot resistance, TPM/off-host services, real Vault migration, protected activation, PF27 process-isolation qualification, policy/event protocol redesign and other platforms.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 security levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md), feature PF-20.
- Product citation: **Non-negotiable controls** — “Record tamper-evident policy decisions, tool calls, approvals, signatures, and transaction or order IDs without secrets.”
- Product decision: **Data-rollback scope decision — 2026-09-04** permits local controller authority under trusted kernel/administrator/controller-store assumptions; whole-machine rollback is outside scope.
- [Design](../../../../qa/security-levels/planning/parallel-handoffs-2026-09-04-round-5/protected-audit-root-design.md) supplies the construction proposal, subject to that resolved threat model and this exact allocation.
- S02 and PF41S03 remain completed foundations, not native implementation proof. PF27S04 consumes this independent root; it is not a dependency of this sprint.

## Code boundaries

- New leaf crate protected-state may depend on existing audit/config/policy and crypto/OS crates, never Core or Vault.
- Existing Core private AuthoritativeStateAnchorStore receives a narrow wrapper; shared security/mod.rs registration remains root-owned.
- PF41 IntegrityRootStore is consumed unchanged. No new ambiguity variant or second policy journal without root allocation.
- Broker service/platform probes remain exclusively PF27-owned. No worker-visible arbitrary path/UID/file capability constructor.
- Read Rust/Core policies and path-types skill before implementing path-bearing types.

## Preconditions

- [x] Active plan; PF20S02, PF41S03 and PF27S03 archived.
- [x] User authorized rolling allocations and resolved the local-data rollback threat model.
- [x] Exact new worktree/base/branch reserved; PF30S01 returned to draft with frozen handoff, without claiming completion.
- [x] Inspect actual interfaces and required nested policies; verify leaf DAG before requesting shared registration (coordinator registration `695704d8e`).

## Done

- [x] Read-only architecture identifies enrollment, exact durable CAS, narrow capability bootstrap, ambiguity and missing-native-provider requirements.

- [x] Implement bounded, owner/key/namespace-bound authenticated checkpoints using existing config/journal types where appropriate; no self-selected authority.
- [x] Explicit one-time enrollment and authenticated Genesis; normal startup opens existing only. Lost/corrupt registry, head or key denies. Interrupted enrollment requires human reconciliation.
- [x] Exact full-value CAS, checked monotone successor, process-wide exclusive ownership, no-follow directory-relative operations, sync file then atomic publication then directory sync before success.
- [x] Fail closed on stale/foreign/overflow/torn state and unsupported Linux filesystem/kernel operations. Post-publication ambiguity latches unavailable; no blind retry or fallback to an older root.
- [x] Build narrow authenticated native client/service construction with actual post-exec peer and generation binding; root-ready witness is not full ProtectedModeAuthorization. Production entry stays gated; coordinator accepted root-anchor/distinct-child composition only as a staged design, not deployment approval.
- [x] Reuse PF41 journal root-last recovery and PF20 policy anchor-first recovery; implement thin adapters without changing their authority/persistence semantics.
- [x] Prove restored/deleted agent data is rejected against intact controller state; document whole-controller snapshot rollback as excluded rather than a passing protection test (unprivileged real PF41 consumer and synthetic Core adapter tests, not privileged deployment).
- [x] Test enrollment interruption, restart, competing processes, wrong identity, short writes/fsync/ENOSPC/ack loss, stale channels and inherited-socketpair negative control with synthetic data.
- [x] Produce exact PF27 consumer handoff and proposed privileged qualification requirements. No sudo, principal/ACL/service setup or real credentials under this allocation. Broker and coordinator accepted the seam; revised privileged installation manifest remains unapproved.
- [x] Qualify combined integration source `b12e32db398c83854271e2e70f29e5290278af8b` on RTX: controller18, Core127, audit46, config229, memory44+3, UI235, actual-key TMUX4 and same-home restart passed. [Final evidence](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-20-S03/combined-b12e32d/README.md); no source/lock/formatter delta, review budget2/5 unchanged.

## Remaining

None within this bounded dependency. Native privileged composition and deployment qualification remain PF27 work, not an acceptance claim of this archive.

## Verification

- [x] RTX only under shared build flock: scoped just fix, full just fmt, focused protected-state/config/security-audit/Core adapter suites; root serializes Cargo/Bazel changes. Final leaf18/Core17/audit46/config229 passed; Cargo/Bazel parity passed. Any subsequent source change must rerun affected gates.
- [x] Use unprivileged real subprocess tests plus fault injection; never claim separate-principal isolation from same-user fixtures.
- [x] No new UI: supporting actual-key TMUX /security, /status, cancel/exit/restart retained visible unavailable protected state. Final source `8d6967179`; immutable CLI SHA256 `42fe2d0168a4f9079f6faa4f4a7b6aa41deabe6f1322d0e921b8c40b4cfc4076`; eleven captures and exact commands in PF20S03 QA.
- [x] Astra High and Fable5.1 High via Corbanu/private TMUX;2/5 used. Astra1 found one verified P2, fixed/tested in `8d6967179`; Fable2 verifies fix and reports no code blockers, plus two nonblocking documentation/environment notes. Neither helper result is mislabeled clean. Exact dispositions under QA; root owns shared ledger refresh. No review-budget reset of frozen PF30S01 or PF27.
- [x] Coordinator combined-tree tests and lock/governance checks; native privileged qualification remains PF27 integration evidence.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Exact implementation commit, tests, fault outcomes, keys/captures and review dispositions under QA.
- [x] Separate algorithm/native transport proof from missing principal-isolation/production activation proof. No platform, human or release acceptance implied.
- [x] Record TensorCash/Isometric applicability: no repository-specific behavior in this leaf; final release qualification in both remains required.
- [x] Done/Remaining reflect reality; archive only this bounded dependency after required evidence and root integration, not the composed protected workflow.
