# PF-19-S02 — Dispatch revocation fence contract

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: Extend accepted revocation types with a precise dispatch fence for queued and admitted work.
- Excludes: transport adapters, durable store wiring, financial recovery implementation and kill-switch TUI.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 security levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md).
- Feature: `PF-19`.
- Product citation: **Reconciled security scope — TO BUILD** — “Unknown or unsupported protected paths fail visibly rather than falling back to raw secrets or unscreened execution.”
- Acceptance advanced: [architecture refinements](../../../plans/security-architecture-refinements-2026-08-28.md); preserve the completed S01 and its historical evidence, with only added guarantees in this follow-up.

## Code boundaries

- OpenClaw adoption: OC-2 in the [pinned source review](../../../plans/openclaw-source-review-2026-08-28.md), commit `13adff02ca3897768d80d2bca18f5acf08c55d91`; named source tests are references, not candidate passes.

- Writable: `codex-rs/security-policy/src/revocation.rs` and
  `security_policy_tests.rs`. Existing `grant.rs` and `mandate.rs` are read-only
  contract context in this lane.
- Consumers: PF-13-S04/PF-27 transport, PF-38-S03 financial recovery and PF-25 stop UI.

## Preconditions

- [x] Plan active; all dependencies completed and archived.
- [x] Assign a named execution owner and exact plan-matching worktree/branch/base; reserve disjoint scopes and integration gate if parallel.
- [x] Read root and nearest implementation AGENTS.md; run the sprint checker before readiness.

## Done

- [x] Follow-up separated from the accepted upstream foundation; no new implementation or qualification claimed.
- [x] Define queued, admitted, uploading and established-channel transitions and the linearization point after which no new protected dispatch or channel write is permitted.
- [x] Require current run/revocation generation at every protected dispatch; reject stale authority and specify how adapters fence open channels, in-flight uploads and queued work without revoking unaffected siblings.
- [x] Emergency kill and restriction take effect even when audit storage is unavailable or an earlier financial effect is submitted/unknown. Preserve uncertainty for later reconciliation; never claim completed effects can be undone.
- [x] Add deterministic interleaving, repeated kill, stale-generation, open-channel, audit-unavailable and unknown-financial-outcome contract tests. Retain the accepted generation/order/idempotency tests; actual transport/restart proof remains with consumers.

## Remaining

- [x] Integration owner added the reserved public re-exports, validated the combined tree, and archived the accepted sprint without activating a transport consumer.

## Verification

- [x] `cd codex-rs && just fix -p codex-security-policy && just fmt` before final affected tests.
- [x] `cd codex-rs && just test -p codex-security-policy revocation && just test -p codex-security-policy`.
- [x] TUI applicability: none; PF-25 and PF-26 retain interactive kill/recovery proof. The focused suite also passed in a real TMUX PTY.
- [x] Integration-owner final-tree rerun after the shared export-only edit and serialized merge: `codex-security-policy` passed 46/46 on the final combined tree.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Record implementation commit, changed paths, contract version and exact final-tree commands/results under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-19-S02/`.
- [x] Preserve S01 archive/evidence unchanged; do not relabel historical passes as proof of these new cases.
- [x] Record consumer integration handoff; all lane-owned ledgers are complete. Plan/navigation/archive remain integration-owner-only.
- [x] Integration owner recorded merge `bff3fe02f`, export commit `1f03913ea`, and final combined-tree qualification before moving this record to the archive with plan/navigation updates.
