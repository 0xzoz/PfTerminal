# PF-24-S02 — Security confirm, cancel, and downgrade

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: the trusted TUI confirms, cancels, persists, and reports security-level transitions.
- Excludes: temporary-grant editor, kill switch, protected-action preview, and release qualification.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 `/security` levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md)
- Feature: `PF-24`
- Reconciliation: [source decisions and archive mapping](../../../plans/security-source-reconciliation.md).
- Product citation: **P0 `/security` levels** — “Existing approval, sandbox, vault, wallet, tool, network, and agent policies are unchanged.”
- Acceptance advanced: Esc changes nothing; confirmation applies immediately; downgrade shows removed protections first.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: `tui/src/app/config_persistence.rs`; `tui/src/bottom_pane/approval_overlay.rs`
- Planned: `tui/src/security/{confirm,events}.rs`; Core transition event wiring
- Tests: sibling tests, app event tests, and reviewed snapshots

## Preconditions

- [ ] PF-24-S03 (flagged picker), PF-23-S03, PF-24-S01, PF-29-S02 are completed and archived.
- [ ] Read root, Rust, Core, TUI, and TUI style instructions.
- [ ] Exact worktree coordinates match the active plan.

## Done

Gate: [qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-24-S02/README.md](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-24-S02/README.md).

- [x] Sprint record is linked only to PF-24.
- [x] PF-29 preflight before protected activation: Core's level is raised only after the preflight passed and was
  rechecked on Enter. The preflight now also requires `source_envelopes` (Core's protected levels refuse
  unlabelled external content). A save whose Core step did not finish is reported at the next start; nothing
  weaker applies.
- [x] Differences first: the Aggressive review shows each row now and under Aggressive, the controls that turn on,
  and what Core's level does now; the downgrade review lists every protection removed at the next start (red
  heading) and Core's timing, and warns when a project, profile, `-c` or managed layer keeps a stricter level.
- [x] One typed human-origin event: the review's accept key builds one `TransitionRequest`
  (`tui/src/security/confirm.rs`), committed on its own thread through `codex_core::security_level_change` into
  PF-23-S03's `commit_transition`. No `Op`, app-server method or tool reaches it.
- [x] Enter commits and shows success or an actionable failure; Esc changes nothing. A stricter Core level applies
  to this process's sessions now; a downgrade saves now and applies at the next start (its revocation applies now).
- [x] A failed save restores the previous files, keeps the view open (Enter reviews again, Esc goes back) and shows
  the level only after the commit. A state changed elsewhere since the review is refused with "review it again".
- [x] Regressions with snapshots: confirm, cancel, downgrade, write failure, changed state, threaded save, unknown
  Core state (repaired by a confirmed level), agent rewrite of the level file, restart.
- [x] PF-24-S03 follow-ups: tamper check (a level file weaker than Core's confirmed record reads as invalid, so
  Aggressive stays enforced, also for nested-launch checks); "restart now" (`r` after a save; same program,
  arguments and folder, with a marker so the initial prompt and images aren't sent again); a second Permissive launch no longer removes the rule file or
  registry entry while an Aggressive process of the same home holds `security_level.lock`.
- [x] PF-23-S03 hand-offs: the commit runs off the async runtime; `security_level.toml` and `security_state.json`
  are reconciled (above); `StoredLevelChanged`/`StoredStateChanged` lead back to a fresh review; an unreadable
  state is repaired by a confirmed level and its session kill switch ends with "restart now"; a downgrade
  rewrites `config.toml` only when it sets a stricter level.

## Remaining

Nothing in this sprint. Merged in #253; the GLM 5.2 pass (four videos: confirm, cancel, downgrade, restart now) was
added afterwards. Follow-ups: Windows "restart now" doesn't ignore Ctrl-C in the waiting parent; a downgrade doesn't
rewrite a profile-v2 user config path (errs strict); startup warnings aren't shown in tmux runs (existing display
path). Known limits are in the gate record.

## Verification

- [x] `just fix -p codex-tui -p codex-core -p codex-security-level -p codex-cli`; `just fmt`.
- [x] `just test -p codex-tui` (security, pf_24, pf_29 sets), `just test -p codex-core -p codex-security-level`
  (`security_transition`, `security_recovery`, `security_confirm`, `pf_29`).
- [x] Snapshots reviewed and accepted (PF-24 output only).
- [x] Linux clippy (`-D warnings`) on the RTX box.
- [x] GLM 5.2 tmux functional pass with videos (confirm, cancel, downgrade, restart now; `qa/demos/index/PF-24-S02.md`).
- [x] Full isolated code-blind VM run and human sign-off are milestone gates only (Aggressive/Moderate ship, flag removal).

## Exit evidence

- [x] Commit, snapshots, changed paths and key script in the gate record.
- [x] Test output under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-24-S02/`.
- [x] Ledgers reflect reality and the completed record is archived.
