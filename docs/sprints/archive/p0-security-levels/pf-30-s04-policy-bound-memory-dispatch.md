# PF-30-S04 — Policy-bound stage-one memory dispatch

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: the existing stage-one worker obtains an opaque client from its owning live session; unsupported protected, unavailable or wrong-owner dispatch fails closed, including retries.
- Excludes: positive protected inference, persistent provenance/taint, phase-two redesign, new policy settings, memory activation, OS setup and PF-35 qualification.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 security levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md), feature PF-30.
- Product citation: **Non-negotiable controls** — “Classify instruction intent and provenance before external content can influence tools or financial actions.”
- This independent denial boundary consumes the completed PF-22-S02 runtime-policy contract, not unfinished PF-30-S01 screening or PF-30-S02 persistence.
- [Design and exact API proposal](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-30-S04/memory-policy-binding-design.md) is adopted with this mandate as authority; its original preparation-only status is retained as historical provenance.
- PF-30-S02 remains draft with its existing dependencies. Execution order 77 is a topological identifier, not a requirement to wait for every lower-numbered unrelated sprint.

## Code boundaries

- Worker-owned paths are literal in front matter; shared exports and suite registries remain coordinator-owned.
- Use a CodexThread-derived opaque factory and dedicated stage-one facade, never a public policy setter or arbitrary authority selector.
- client.rs and session/mod.rs ownership is transferred from PF-30-S01 before dispatch. Neither lane edits the other's files.

## Preconditions

- [x] Active plan and completed/archived PF-22-S02 runtime contract.
- [x] User authorized rolling replacement lanes; coordinator records this genuine single-feature contract split without enabling protected memory.
- [x] Exact branch/worktree/base and non-overlapping scope allocated.
- [x] Read root/Rust/Core/TUI policies and verify source/API assumptions before implementation.

## Done

- [x] Existing detached construction, lower-level retry risk and historical-source/runtime-owner distinction documented.
- [x] Host-owned factory/opaque facade, per-attempt guard, worker routing/persistence and expanded canary/TMUX tests implemented and qualified on RTX.
- [x] [Versioned evidence and limitations](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-30-S04/qualification.md) created; Astra P2 corrected and qualified with full memories-write 44/44 and actual-key TMUX. Fable confirms correctness with one documented non-blocking P3 optimization; 2/5 reviews used.

- [x] Implement one host-owned opaque stage-one client factory; expected identity/provider are assertions, never authority selectors. Unknown/uninitialized/terminated/mismatched bindings deny.
- [x] Preserve maximum configured/current/inherited policy floor; fail closed for all protected raw-rollout dispatch independently of admission/screening readiness.
- [x] Check at actual HTTP retry dispatch and post-connect WebSocket send, then stream completion and before worker success persistence. Preserve Permissive payload, proxy, auth and cache shaping.
- [x] Remove detached worker construction; use current per-job context, typed bounded denial and finite existing retry/backoff. Do not mark denied/EOF/cancelled work successful.
- [x] Preserve feature-disabled, ephemeral, non-root and unavailable-DB skips; no new model traffic or memory activation.
- [x] Cover real worker canary paths, wrong owner, live increase barriers, provider replacement, HTTP/WS retry, restart/cancel and legacy/mixed/forged sources. Historical rollout IDs remain data, not runtime owner IDs.

- [x] Complete the allocated independent reviews and disposition findings: corrected P2, documented deferred P3 allocation/contention optimization without weakening checks.

## Remaining

- [x] Coordinator merged at 6a6bb029d and completed [combined qualification](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-30-S04/combined-qualification.md): Core110, write44, read3, UI235, actual-key TMUX4 all passed; immutable hash recorded. Archived after final-tree gates.

## Verification

- [x] RTX only: scoped just fix, full just fmt, affected Core and full memories-write suites; relevant memories-read regression suite.
- [x] Fake providers and synthetic fixtures only; prove zero canary-bearing requests under protected/unavailable policy and unchanged Permissive success.
- [x] Actual-key TMUX startup/turn/cancel/restart with memory-enabled isolated home and recorded fake-provider/DB outcomes; text and Enter separately.
- [x] Astra High and Fable 5.1 High review via Corbanu/private TMUX with exact frozen source; 2/5 invocations, no redundant reviews.
- [x] Coordinator exports/registries, unchanged locks, combined-tree and governance checks passed; scoped fix/fullfmt produced no diff.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Commit, immutable RTX binary hash, tests, keys/captures and review dispositions recorded under the new QA directory.
- [x] Denial-only boundary and remaining persistence/positive-screening limitations explicit; no human, cross-platform or release pass inferred.
- [x] Done/Remaining reflect reality; archived with exact combined evidence. No whole-feature memory provenance or positive protected inference claim.
