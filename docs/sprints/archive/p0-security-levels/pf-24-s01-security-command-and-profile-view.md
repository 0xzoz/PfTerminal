# PF-24-S01 — Security command and profile view

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: `/security` opens a focused, keyboard-navigable view of the current level and three profiles.
- Excludes: applying changes, downgrade confirmation, temporary grants, kill switch, and release TUI qualification.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 `/security` levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md)
- Feature: `PF-24`
- Reconciliation: [source decisions and archive mapping](../../../plans/security-source-reconciliation.md).
- Product citation: **P0 `/security` levels** — “Existing approval, sandbox, vault, wallet, tool, network, and agent policies are unchanged.”
- Acceptance advanced: the user can understand current protection and profile differences without internal policy vocabulary.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: `tui/src/slash_command.rs`; `tui/src/chatwidget/slash_dispatch.rs`
- Planned: `tui/src/security/{mod,view}.rs`; `tui/src/bottom_pane/security_view.rs`
- Tests: sibling tests and `insta` snapshots under the owning modules

## Preconditions

- [x] PF-20-S02 and PF-22-S02 are completed and archived.
- [x] Read root, `codex-rs/AGENTS.md`, `codex-rs/tui/AGENTS.md`, and `tui/styles.md`.
- [x] Exact worktree coordinates match the active plan.

## Done

- [x] Sprint record is linked only to PF-24.

- [x] Distinguish requested configuration from unavailable effective protection; no healthy protected badge is manufactured. PF-41 owns authenticated detailed runtime inspection.
- [x] Register and route `/security` without changing `/permissions`.
- [x] Render requested level, concise profile summaries, and Permissive/Moderate/Aggressive exploration.
- [x] Support configured Up/Down equivalents, inert Enter inspection, and Esc cancellation without mutation.
- [x] Keep 40-column terminals readable and expose the requested/unverified state in `/status`.
- [x] Add focused behavior tests and reviewed snapshots for every profile, narrow width, and unknown-state error.
- [x] Coordinator-numbered Astra High review 2 and Fable 5.1 High review 3 both returned no findings; original structured verdicts retained in lane QA. Three of five invocations used including the old-CLI rejection.
- [x] Coordinator completed combined-tree qualification at dd2adb72b: focused Core 94/94 and actual-key TMUX 3/3; unchanged combined UI 235/235 reused explicitly. Full protected activation and PF-26 qualification remain separate.

## Remaining

None within this observation-only sprint.

## Verification

- [x] Complete coordinator-numbered Astra High and Fable 5.1 High independent reviews, with verified disposition and no source remediation required.
- [x] Integration owner repeated applicable standalone gates on the combined three-lane tree; final source, candidate hash, filters, run IDs and safe evidence paths are in the [combined qualification](../../../../qa/security-levels/planning/parallel-handoffs-2026-09-04-round-5/combined-qualification.md).
- [x] Fix: `cd codex-rs && just fix -p codex-tui`; final source passed on RTX.
- [x] Format: complete `just fmt` passed after coordinator supplied uv 0.11.3; no file changes and final tested source remains exact.
- [x] Final-tree focused TUI test: 235/235 security-view/status/slash-command cases passed; exact filter and run ID in lane evidence.
- [x] Snapshot review: four new profile and 21 affected status snapshots inspected and accepted.
- [x] Actual-key TMUX: 2/2 tests passed covering three configuration levels, 120/40/80 columns, inert Enter, Esc/reopen, unknown-state startup failure and `/status`; PF-26-S02 retains final composed qualification.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Source commit `0ecb19969`, snapshots, candidate hash, changed paths and actual key script recorded.
- [x] Test output and safe captures linked under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-24-S01/`.
- [x] Ledgers reflect reality and the completed record is archived. Human acceptance, live-repository, cross-platform and benchmark/release qualification remain unclaimed; no protected-mode activation is included.
