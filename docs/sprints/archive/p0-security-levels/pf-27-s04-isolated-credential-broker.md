# PF-27-S04 — Isolated credential broker process

## Closure — 2026-10-06

Completed under the per-sprint gate (sec-common decision 5): focused tests, GLM 5.2 tmux run, one Opus 5.5 High
review (APPROVE WITH NITS, no P0/P1) and SOP demo videos, all in the
[evidence](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/isolated-broker-20261006/README.md). Merged as PR #180
(`13cf4a2d0c`) behind `isolated_credential_broker` (default off). The coordinator's 2026-10-06 decision moved the
open items out, so nothing below is claimed as done here:

| Carried forward | To |
| --- | --- |
| Core's own model-client auth through the broker; vault-label credentials resolved inside the broker | [PF-27-S05](pf-27-s05-model-client-auth-broker.md) (completed 2026-10-07) |
| Broker same-uid and unsandboxed; agent access to controller memory/environ; broker socket in an agent-writable directory; macOS setup-pipe inheritance window | [PF-27-S02](pf-27-s02-secretless-agent-launch.md) |
| Windows broker (today Windows fails closed: dummies, no injection) | [PF-27-S06](../../archive/p1-security-hardening/pf-27-s06-windows-broker-and-launch.md) (new) |
| Production revocation trigger (`revoke_brokered_credentials` has no product caller) | [PF-23-S03](../../current/p0-security-levels/pf-23-s03-downgrade-restart-and-inheritance-enforcement.md) |
| Known limits with the flag on: no broker restart until a new session; only GET/HEAD/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE and paths up to 1,024 bytes; private-IP GitHub Enterprise needs `allow_local_binding`; uploads over 5 minutes are cut off and an unread response holds a broker slot | Documented behaviour; not scheduled |

**October 6 (decision 5 gate):** the isolated broker process ships behind the `isolated_credential_broker` feature flag (default off; Permissive unchanged). Inventory: all 17 commits on `feat/security-broker-resume-20260911` were already on main as equivalent commits, so nothing was redone. The review-budget and system-preflight micro-allocations below are superseded. [Evidence](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/isolated-broker-20261006/README.md).

**September14:** owner returned paused reservation to draft for PF-83; no cancellation/completion/resumption. [Handoff preserves coordinates, checkpoints, reviews and A-D evidence](../../../../qa/reliability/live-permission-transition-20260913/expanded-allocation.md). **User-requested management pause, September 13.** Accepted work integrated; owner/probes stopped. [Checkpoint and gates](../../../plans/management-pause-2026-09-13.md). No answer requested; continuation mandates below suspended. Earlier September 11 resumption is historical: recovered `security-round5-broker` at pushed `cd7457da7`; do not redo it. The [resume handoff](../../../../qa/security-levels/planning/parallel-handoffs-2026-09-04-round-5/RESUME-20260911.md) records exact coordinates, review history and unchanged native setup limits.

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: Raw credentials exist only in the trusted broker; a compromised agent process cannot call an unrestricted resolver.
- Excludes: adjacent feature implementation, Permissive policy changes, and unlisted integrations.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 `/security` levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md#pf-27).
- Feature: `PF-27`.
- Product citation: **Non-negotiable controls** — “Permit agents to reference credentials only by label; resolve them solely inside the trusted execution boundary.”
- Acceptance advanced: Raw credentials exist only in the trusted broker; a compromised agent process cannot call an unrestricted resolver.
- Sources and archive disposition: [PF-27 reconciliation](../../../plans/security-source-reconciliation.md#pf-27).

## Code boundaries
- OpenClaw adoption reference: [OC-1](../../../plans/openclaw-source-review-2026-08-28.md#oc-1), [OC-2](../../../plans/openclaw-source-review-2026-08-28.md#oc-2) at `13adff02ca3897768d80d2bca18f5acf08c55d91`; see the review for named functions, callers, tests and limits. Reference tests are not candidate evidence.

- Existing/foundation: codex-rs/vault/src/lib.rs; codex-rs/network-proxy/src/credential_broker.rs; PF-13 Core capability store.
- Completed bounded source: service `src/launch/`, `src/probe/`, narrow registration and separate tests; [launcher recipe/identity preparation proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/launcher-20260912/README.md). No fixed listener, native client, PF20/Core/Vault edit or privileged execution.
- Tests: planned colocated Rust test modules prefixed `pf_27_s01`; fixtures use synthetic secrets and fake services only.

## Preconditions
- [x] All dependencies in front matter are completed and archived; plan remains active.
- [x] Read root and nearest implementation-path AGENTS.md; verified exact plan/worktree coordinates.
- [x] Accepted the PF-27-S03 Linux service, macOS launchd/XPC and Windows service/AppContainer candidates for construction; protected eligibility and sprint completion remain blocked until measured all-OS qualification passes.
## Done
- [x] Isolated broker process behind `isolated_credential_broker`: Core's network proxy hands provider credentials (GitHub/OpenAI env tokens) to a separate `corbanu --codex-run-as-credential-broker` process over private pipes and keeps only dummy values plus opaque references. The broker accepts typed, HMAC-signed, replay-checked provider requests from the controller pid only, enforces the host binding and exact method/path, substitutes the header and performs the upstream HTTPS request. Revocation, broker death and restart close channels and never fall back to raw injection. Tests, GLM 5.2 tmux run, review and videos: [evidence](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/isolated-broker-20261006/README.md).
- [x] Old Remaining list closed by that increment: the preflight receiving-proof allocation is superseded by decision 5. The increment covers: fresh connections and new generations cannot reuse old references (`stale_generation`, `unknown_credential`); open-stream revocation, other-run frames (`binding_mismatch`) and restart with old handles; versioned, bounded IPC with OS-peer, session/task/run, replay and malformed-frame checks; typed operations only, with no raw fallback on broker death; crash, cross-run, wrong-peer, forged-reference, bounded-resource and concurrent-revoke tests; named `pf_27_s01` tests and the Cargo lock. PF-13's exact OpenAI adapter is unchanged.
- [x] Private preflight source19f662493/Rust09f723:30 commands+suite0, five new cases and retained strict/parity/non-root RTX TMUX proof; Astra39/Fable40 exit0/findings[].

- [x] Private dispatch sourcec7d48e482/Rustbd56b597:28 commands+suite0, six real pair/PF20 cases, retained suites/strict lint/parity/actual RTX TMUX; Astra35/Fable36 exit0/findings[]. [Proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/descriptor-root-dispatch-20260912/README.md). Internal-only N/A; no native/product readiness.
- [x] Descriptor compatibility d776e938d/Rustb48e9c4f: all25 commands+suite0, retained identity2 and both transport entries/five rejection scenarios, strict lint/parity; Astra33/Fable34 exit0/findings[]. [Proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/descriptor-root-compat-20260912/README.md). Internal/default-OFF only; original failures retained.
- [x] Manager accepted receiving Stage B e1cc38a70/Rust2588dfe0 after reading all17 command exits+suite0, actual RTX/TMUX/provenance/test summaries and unchanged module/lock pairs. Internal increment only; original failures/reviews retained.
- [x] StageB source7839f9f65/Rust5a4ee88b:892lines/same7paths within amended900; all18 repairedexits0, admission8/tenactualpeer scenarios, service59+11separatelycovered exclusions, preservedA/adapter suites, strictlint/parity/actual-keyRTXTMUX pass. Astra30 bufferedEOF reproduced/fixed, Fable31 receipt fixed, Fable32 patchcorrect/exit1 soleP3 count fixed without runtime change or extra review. [Proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/descriptor-admission-20260912/README.md). Privateincrement-only N/A; no product/native acceptance.
- [x] StageA identity/private pair lifecycle sourcee0eb9eac4/Rustf64820d0:614 changed lines, ten allocated paths; adapter4+8/default3/pair5+real1/owner8+real3/profiles2/service57 pass, ignored cases separately exercised; strict scoped Clippy/parity/actual-key RTX TMUX pass; Astra28/Fable29 clean. [Proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/descriptor-pair-20260912/README.md). WIP758-line archive retained; policy1.7 N/A only for this private increment, no product readiness. Manager receiving63cbce998 proof accepted.
- [x] Private single-child owner source4d830cbb3/Rust7e488200: default3/focused8/real3/profile2/service52 pass, four service exclusions exercised separately; actual-key RTX TMUX, strict Clippy and Cargo/Bazel parity pass. Astra25 clean; Fable26 lint finding repaired; Fable27 clean. [Proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/descriptor-owner-20260912/README.md). No two-child/native/product activation claim.
- [x] New single-feature record reconciled with current ownership and archived design input; no implementation claimed.
- [x] Manager accepted/integrated sealed-byte profile proof at main406aa3c5f; source635655c34 and original Astra21/Fable22 outcomes preserved. Travis approved isolated-adapter implementation/non-root proof September12; exact allocation recorded before code, existing branch/base retained.
- [x] Isolated adapter source30b471a47/Rust2d270c5c: focused3/OS7/service44/static-profile2/TMUX7 pass; second GNU2.39 host explicitly rejects unsupported libc (1 pass). Cargo/Bazel parity passes; Astra23/Fable24 clean. [Exact proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/descriptor-launch-20260912/README.md). No service wiring/privileged setup/completion claim.
- [x] Recovered reviewed broker leaves from `cdb821289` in provenance commit `90ae3a0cf`, without overwriting the current allocation or shared registrations.
- [x] Implemented digest-bound PF-41 journal integration and bounded native Linux
  peer/framing/channel teardown primitives, including concurrent disconnect
  cancellation and bounded partial-frame deadlines without idle timeouts.
  Final post-format remote suites pass 338/338 broker/Vault/proxy and 6/6
  focused Core tests; Cargo/Bazel parity passes. Astra and Fable repairs are
  verified; final Fable review has no blocking findings and one deferred P3
  signal-interruption follow-up (helper exit 1). Four of five reviews used.
  Production service, data-plane and all-OS qualification remain open; see `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/round5-evidence.md`.
- [x] Reconciled and qualified the service construction stage on main/0.1.42: default 1, synthetic 6, full affected 338, Core 6 and supporting TMUX pass. Fable review 6 found no runtime/security issue; one test-only lint finding was reproduced and fixed, strict Clippy and affected proof rerun successfully. Six reviews spent, no seventh; see `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/resume-20260911/README.md`. No native deployment or activation claimed.
- [x] Qualified admission/lifetime `bd70f0e6b` ([proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/child-admission-20260912/README.md)) and existing-root adapter `794080a4f` ([proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/root-composition-20260912/README.md)): default3/fixture17/affected356 (2 helper skips), scoped Clippy/parity/TMUX17+exit78 pass. Astra10 clean, Fable11 runtime correct with publication finding resolved; inherited transitive telemetry lint debt retained. Five new slots used. No native installation, executable launcher or protected activation.
- [x] Launch recipe/identity preparation `f0b1209e0`: default3/synthetic29/affected356 (2 existing skips), scoped lint/parity/build/TMUX pass; Astra14 and Fable15 exit0/no findings. P3 Python-path fixture follow-up fixed. No actual root-positive or native-eligibility claim; [evidence](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/launcher-20260912/README.md).
- [x] Fixed manifest/image inspection `099fa6f6d`: default3/synthetic35/affected356 (2 existing skips), scoped lint/parity/build/TMUX pass; Astra16/Fable17 clean. Initial fixture failures retained. No spawn authority or native qualification; [proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/manifest-20260912/README.md).
- [x] Sealed image `ee1ac023c`: default3/synthetic39/affected356 (2 existing skips), scoped lint/parity/build/TMUX pass; Astra18/Fable19 clean. Kernel write/truncate/seal denials and failure cleanup proven; no invocation or loader trust. [Proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/sealed-20260912/README.md).
- [x] Static probe build/linkage feasibility passes on unchanged Rust0aa65bd: staticPIE f6ca8e3368dc/no interpreter or external libs and GNU control, actual-key TMUX. Fable20 patch correct/P3 receipt gap repaired; original exit1 and failed attempts retained. No artifact invocation/native qualification. [Proof](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/static-probe-20260912/CURRENT.md).
## Remaining
- [x] Every open item moved out on 2026-10-06; see the closure table above.

## Verification
- [x] Independent isolated execution: not a per-sprint gate under decision 5; it runs at the "Aggressive ships", "Moderate ships" and flag-removal milestones.
- [x] `just fix` and `just fmt` on the touched crates (evidence README).
- [x] Focused: `just test -p codex-secret-broker pf_27_s01` (24) and `just test -p codex-core pf_27_s01` (2); both ran.
- [x] Integration: affected crates 334 passed, related Core 88 passed; Cargo lock updated in PR #180.
- [x] TUI applicability: none; the GLM 5.2 tmux run covers the agent-visible behaviour.
- [x] Candidate, commands, expected/actual outcomes and recording digests recorded in the evidence README; synthetic credentials only.

## Exit evidence
- [x] Implementation commit `cf852aa347` / merge `13cf4a2d0c`; outputs under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S04/isolated-broker-20261006/`.
- [x] Acceptance shown by the tmux cases V0-V3 and three SOP videos (`qa/demos/index/PF-27-S04.md`).
- [x] PF-26 final qualification moved to the P1 hardening plan (decision 3); no release-complete claim here.
- [x] Done/Remaining reflect reality; record archived and the plan/index updated.
