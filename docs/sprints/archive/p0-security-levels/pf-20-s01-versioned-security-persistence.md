# PF-20-S01 — Versioned security persistence reconciliation

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: verify typed, versioned level persistence with explicit corrupt/unknown-state failure.
- Excludes: TUI confirmation, effective runtime policy, downgrade invalidation, and audit persistence.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P0 `/security` levels](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-08-p0-security-levels.md)
- Feature: `PF-20`
- Acceptance advanced: restart restores a known level without transiently weakening policy.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: `codex-rs/config/src/config_toml.rs`; `codex-rs/core/src/config/{mod,edit}.rs`
- Generated/build: `codex-rs/core/config.schema.json`; Cargo and Bazel dependency files
- Tests: `codex-rs/core/src/config/{config_tests,edit_tests}.rs`

## Preconditions

- [x] PF-15-S01 is completed and archived.
- [x] Exact worktree coordinates match the plan.
- [x] Read `codex-rs/AGENTS.md` and `codex-rs/core/AGENTS.md` before corrective work.

## Record creation

- [x] Sprint record is linked to PF-20.
- [x] Commit `0e3f2dfd92` added versioned config, schema, editing, and persistence tests.

## Done

- [x] Review legacy absence, explicit Permissive, unknown version, corrupt level, and atomic-write behavior.
- [x] Run `just write-config-schema` and prove the checked-in schema matches generated types.
- [x] Run `just bazel-lock-update` if dependency metadata changes and include Bazel parity.
- [x] Record any corrective commit and final changed paths.

## Remaining

- None.

## Verification

- [x] Fix: `cd codex-rs && just fix -p codex-config && just fix -p codex-core`.
- [x] Format: `cd codex-rs && just fmt`; then inspect the final diff.
- [x] Focused tests: `cd codex-rs && just test -p codex-config && just test -p codex-core config::`.
- [x] Schema: `cd codex-rs && just write-config-schema`; final diff is empty or intentional.
- [x] TUI applicability: none; PF-24 owns interactive persistence.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Commits, generated-schema result, and changed paths recorded.
- [x] Test output linked under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-20-S01/`.
- [x] Ledgers reflect reality and the completed record is archived.
