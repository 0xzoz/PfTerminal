# CSA-02 / PF-43-S01 — Managed token lifecycle

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: encrypted add/replace/status/resolve/remove lifecycle for one long-lived Claude subscription token.
- Excludes: provider routing, platform credential discovery, setup-token TUI orchestration, and migration UX.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Reliable Claude subscription authentication](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-14-unified-provider-auth.md).
- Feature: `PF-43` (plan alias `CSA-02`).
- Acceptance advanced: store the recommended method only in an approved secret backend and inspect metadata without revealing it.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: `codex-rs/vault/src/lib.rs`; CSA-01 typed contract.
- Planned: managed-token operations and tests in `codex-rs/vault/src/claude_auth*.rs`.

## Preconditions

- [x] Plan is active.
- [x] PF-42-S01 is completed and archived.
- [x] Worktree, branch, and base commit match the plan.
- [x] Serial scope and integration gate are recorded.

## Done

- [x] Sprint record created and linked to PF-43.
- [x] Added bounded token validation plus encrypted add/replace and metadata-only status.
- [x] Added a dedicated short provider callback and exact local removal without changing Claude-owned stores.
- [x] Denied generic reveal, programmatic export, and scoped-capability resolution for the provider-managed token.
- [x] Proved token values stay out of metadata, errors, debug formatting, and encrypted-state inspection.

## Remaining

- [x] None.

## Verification

- [x] `cd codex-rs && just fix -p codex-vault && just fmt` preceded final tests.
- [x] `cd codex-rs && just test -p codex-vault --retries 0` passed 44 of 44 tests.
- [x] TUI applicability: none in this lifecycle-only sprint.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Implementation commit `6e4069ea1` and final-tree tests are recorded above.
- [x] Official setup-token eligibility/lifetime/limitations citation is recorded in the plan.
- [x] Done and Remaining reflect reality; completed record is archived.
