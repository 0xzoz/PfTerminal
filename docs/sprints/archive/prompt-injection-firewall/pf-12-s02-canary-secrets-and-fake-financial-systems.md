# PF-12-S02 — Canary secrets and fake financial systems

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: Provision recoverable fake secrets, wallets, brokers, and market actions for adversarial tests.
- Excludes: implementation owned by any plan feature other than `PF-12`.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Prompt-injection firewall and brokered authority](../../../plans/proposed/prompt-injection-firewall.md)
- Feature: `PF-12` — Security regression and red-team harness
- Acceptance advanced: Provision recoverable fake secrets, wallets, brokers, and market actions for adversarial tests.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: `codex-rs/core/tests/`; `codex-rs/tui/tests/`; `benchmarks/`
- Planned: `scripts/security/`; `qa/security/`; `qa/release/security/`
- Tests: `scripts/security/tests/`

## Preconditions

- [ ] The linked plan is active.
- [ ] Dependencies are completed: `PF-12-S01`.
- [ ] Worktree, branch, and base commit are exact and match the active plan.

## Done

- [x] Sprint record created, bounded, and linked to one plan feature.

## Remaining

- [ ] Create synthetic vault references and canary values that can never authorize real systems.
- [ ] Implement fake quote, order, signing, broadcasting, and receipt services with complete audit capture.
- [ ] Fail tests on model-visible canaries, unauthorized side effects, or missing deterministic receipts.

## Verification

- [ ] Focused final-tree command: `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/security/tests -v`
- [ ] Regression fixtures for this sprint pass.
- [ ] TUI applicability: Not standalone; real-TUI qualification is owned by PF-12-S06.

## Exit evidence

- [ ] Implementation commit and changed paths recorded.
- [ ] Final-tree test output and failure artifacts linked.
- [ ] Scope diff contains only `PF-12` work.
- [x] Cancelled unstarted and archived by product direction on 2026-08-24.
