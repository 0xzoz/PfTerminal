# PF-08-S02 — Corpus manifest and license gate

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: Create a reproducible manifest for benign, hostile, finance, and hard-negative sources.
- Excludes: implementation owned by any plan feature other than `PF-08`.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Prompt-injection firewall and brokered authority](../../../plans/proposed/prompt-injection-firewall.md)
- Feature: `PF-08` — Local prompt-injection classifier
- Acceptance advanced: Create a reproducible manifest for benign, hostile, finance, and hard-negative sources.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: `codex-rs/core/src/`; `codex-rs/protocol/src/models.rs`
- Planned: `codex-rs/prompt-injection-classifier/src/`; `qa/security/classifier/`
- Tests: planned `codex-rs/prompt-injection-classifier/tests/`

## Preconditions

- [ ] The linked plan is active.
- [ ] Dependencies are completed: `PF-08-S01`.
- [ ] Worktree, branch, and base commit are exact and match the active plan.

## Done

- [x] Sprint record created, bounded, and linked to one plan feature.

## Remaining

- [ ] Record source, license, hash, allowed use, language, domain, and attack family.
- [ ] Reject real customer, credential, wallet, account, and protected financial data.
- [ ] Add duplicate, near-duplicate, source-overlap, and license validation checks.

## Verification

- [ ] Focused final-tree command: `cd codex-rs && just test -p codex-prompt-injection-classifier`
- [ ] Regression fixtures for this sprint pass.
- [ ] TUI applicability: Not standalone; integrated key-driven proof is owned by PF-12-S06.

## Exit evidence

- [ ] Implementation commit and changed paths recorded.
- [ ] Final-tree test output and failure artifacts linked.
- [ ] Scope diff contains only `PF-08` work.
- [x] Cancelled unstarted and archived by product direction on 2026-08-24.
