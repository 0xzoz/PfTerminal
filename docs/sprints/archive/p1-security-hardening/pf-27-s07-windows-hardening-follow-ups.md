# PF-27-S07 — Windows hardening follow-ups

Travis approved fixing the four limits PF-27-S06 documented (2026-10-08). This sprint fixes the two that need no
real Windows machine; the other two are [PF-27-S08](pf-27-s08-windows-broker-restricted-token.md) (the broker's
own token) and [PF-27-S09](pf-27-s09-windows-model-client-auth.md) (Windows model auth). All slices merged (the
one-line `config/mod.rs` hook merged with slice 1, PF-60-S03 holds that file). The real-Windows gate run passed
(2026-10-08).

## Closure — 2026-10-08

Completed. Travis **accepted** PF-27-S07 **with known limits** on 2026-10-08 (in chat with the coordinator): the
limits are the [Known limits](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S07/README.md#known-limits) list in the
evidence README. Received and archived by the P1 integration owner; gate run evidence merged in PR #316.

Follow-ups (linked, not blockers):

- #300 (deny-read not enforced on the unelevated tool path): decided, fail closed; being implemented.
- #301 and #304 (deny entries revoked by a flag-off session / never revoked): decided, rule-driven removal; draft PR #326.
- #320 (`spawn_protected` stdout pipe briefly inheritable, the "broker stdout inheritance" limit): fixed by PR #327.
- #323 (an armed contract's deny entries vs. another `CODEX_HOME`'s sync): open.
- [PF-27-S08](pf-27-s08-windows-broker-restricted-token.md) and
  [PF-27-S09](pf-27-s09-windows-model-client-auth.md): planned.

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: Core and broker threads that no same-user process can open, even right after they are created; the
  `CODEX_HOME` deny removed exactly when `secretless_agent_launch` is off.
- Excludes: the broker's own token (PF-27-S08), Windows model auth (PF-27-S09), macOS/Linux changes, Permissive.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P1 security hardening](../../../plans/active/p1-security-hardening.md#pf-27).
- Feature: `PF-27`.
- Product citation: **Required trust boundaries** — “Credentials are referenced by label and resolved only inside a trusted execution boundary.”
- Acceptance advanced: no raw managed secret enters agent environment, command line or process memory on Windows.

## Code boundaries

- New threads: `process-hardening/src/windows_thread_creation.rs` (`CreateThread` import redirect, token default
  DACL), `windows_protected_spawn.rs` (`spawn_protected`), `windows_process_access.rs`, `broker_containment.rs`;
  the broker's Windows start in `network-proxy/src/credential_broker/isolated/client.rs`.
- `CODEX_HOME` deny: `windows-sandbox-rs/src/acl.rs` (`remove_deny_read_ace_for_new_files`, explicit-deny and
  link helpers), `core/src/security/launch_contract.rs` (armed lock per contract, `release_codex_home_when_unarmed`,
  `CodexHomeLockUnavailable`), `core/src/config/mod.rs`.
- Tests: `pf_27_s07` in process-hardening, windows-sandbox and core, run by `windows-security-probes`.

## Preconditions

- [x] PF-27-S06 slices merged (#267, #269, #270, #272, #277); `windows-2022` runner for real probes.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Every thread Core or the broker creates through `CreateThread` (every Rust thread) has the protected DACL when
   it is created. Measured: a same-user process without privileges, and one under the unelevated sandbox's token,
   cannot open a brand-new thread held in its creation window (created suspended, so its TLS callback has not
   run). Positive control: a thread created without that import can be opened in the same window.
2. The broker is never openable: it starts with protected process and first-thread DACLs, suspended, and its
   token's default DACL is the protected thread DACL before it runs, so every thread it creates, however it is
   started, is protected at creation. Measured with the same probe on both kinds of thread.
3. Threads keep the rights they need on themselves (priority, impersonating themselves).
4. With `secretless_agent_launch` off, the first config load of a process without an armed contract removes exactly
   the `CODEX_HOME` new-file deny (and the copies files in `CODEX_HOME` inherited); every other entry and the
   DACL's protection are unchanged (compared as SDDL). Never while another process has the contract armed.

## Done

- [x] Record created with the follow-up plan records PF-27-S08 and PF-27-S09 (#280).
- [x] Slice 1 (#281): `CODEX_HOME` deny removed exactly on flag-off; each contract holds a shared lock file in
  `CODEX_HOME` (regular, single-link, undeletable while held, its own deny); no lock, no protected launch.
- [x] Slice 2a (#282): Rust threads in Core and the broker protected at creation (`CreateThread` import redirect);
  the broker's token default DACL protects every thread it starts.
- [x] Slice 2b (#284): Core starts the broker with `spawn_protected` (protected process and first thread at
  creation, suspended until its token's default DACL is set): never openable, measured while suspended too.
- [x] Acceptance criteria 1–4 measured on `windows-2022`, each with a positive control
  ([evidence](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S07/README.md)).
- [x] Travis accepted the known limits in the evidence README (2026-10-08): Core threads that other modules start
  rely on the TLS callback and loader workers keep the default DACL; after upgrading, restart protected sessions
  before flag-off; the rest of that list.

## Remaining

None. Follow-ups are listed under Closure.

## Verification

- [x] `pf_27_s07` on `windows-2022` (jobs 113293258039, 113280283309, 113292935422); PF-27-S06 suites still pass;
  Linux clippy `-D warnings` clean on the RTX box; macOS suites pass.
- [x] Opus 5.5 High review per slice: approve (slice 1 after 3 rounds, 2a and 2b after 2).
- [x] GLM 5.2 tmux run and SOP videos on real Windows at `265172beed3d`, normal session: **passed** (Core, new
  threads and broker unopenable; deny removed on flag-off, kept while armed; #294/#295 hold) ([gate run](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S07/README.md#real-windows-gate-run-2026-10-08-pass), [videos](../../../../qa/demos/index/PF-27-S07.md)).
- [x] Gate evidence received by the P1 integration owner (2026-10-08; PR #316).

## Exit evidence

- [x] Outputs under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S07/` ([evidence](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S07/README.md)).
- [x] Record archived (2026-10-08, by the P1 integration owner).
