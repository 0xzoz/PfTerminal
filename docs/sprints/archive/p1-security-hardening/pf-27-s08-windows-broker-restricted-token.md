# PF-27-S08 — Windows broker confined by its own restricted token or AppContainer

Third of the four PF-27-S06 limits Travis approved fixing (2026-10-08). Unlike macOS and Linux (Seatbelt, Landlock),
the Windows broker had only the process DACL and a no-child-process job, so it could write the user's files, open
their processes, or start work through WMI, Task Scheduler or out-of-process COM. Broker lane, 2026-10-08.

## Closure — 2026-10-09

Completed. Travis **accepted** PF-27-S08 **with known limits** on 2026-10-09 (in chat with the coordinator), after
recording key-path decision (c) (PR #360). The limits are the
[Known limits](../../../../qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S08/README.md#known-limits) list in the evidence README:

1. Credential Manager: a compromised broker can read the user's other generic credentials and create new ones
   (measured); overwrite or delete of existing items (including the vault key) was **not probed**, so assume it
   can. Its network is not restricted.
2. Terminate: it can kill the user's ordinary processes; Core is protected.
3. Delete (not create, change or rename) in low-integrity folders (`LocalLow`, `Temp\Low`, likely `Packages\*`,
   `INetCache\Low`).
4. Not probed: squatting low-labeled named objects, pipes or mailslots; `WRITE_DAC`/`WRITE_OWNER` on low-labeled
   files; `HKCU\Software\AppDataLow`. Core trusts the broker's own report of its token.
5. WMI/COM coverage is partial: other COM servers callable by low-integrity clients and the wider RPC surface;
   an AppID granting Everyone, Users or Authenticated Users launch rights bypasses the INTERACTIVE deny.
6. Task Scheduler refuses by hiding its folders; CI's normal-session row has no working control (elevated has one).
7. Real-machine COM control: `MMC20.Application` needs elevation in a normal session, so the elevated run is the
   control there.
8. Parent-process spoofing signal from the holder start.

Received and archived by the P1 integration owner; code in PR #333, decision and main recheck in PR #360.

Follow-ups (linked, not blockers):

- [PF-27-S09](pf-27-s09-windows-model-client-auth.md) (Windows stored-key
  reader and model auth): in progress, PR #363.
- The vault lock S09 needs: each vault read opens `secrets/.vault.lock` for writing, which the S08 token cannot do;
  S09 grants the broker access to it or hands it an opened lock.

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: the Windows broker runs under a token that cannot write outside its own runtime state, open other
  processes of the user (beyond query-limited and terminate, measured), or start work through WMI, Task Scheduler
  or COM, while it still serves its pipes and reaches upstreams; the stored-key path is decided and measured.
- Excludes: Windows model auth and the Windows stored-key reader (PF-27-S09), macOS/Linux, Permissive.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [P1 security hardening](../../../plans/active/p1-security-hardening.md#pf-27).
- Feature: `PF-27`.
- Product citation: **Required trust boundaries** — “Credentials are referenced by label and resolved only inside a trusted execution boundary.”
- Acceptance advanced: the process that holds raw credentials is itself confined on every platform.

## Code boundaries

- `process-hardening/src/windows_protected_spawn.rs` (broker token), `broker_containment.rs` (`token+dacl+job`).
- `network-proxy/src/credential_broker/isolated/pipe.rs`, `server.rs`: pipe DACLs admit the broker token and Core only.

## Preconditions

- [x] PF-27-S07 merged; a real Windows machine (used 2026-10-09); key-path decision (Travis, 2026-10-09: (c)).

## Acceptance criteria

1. The broker starts under the chosen token (spike: AppContainer with `internetClient` and
   `privateNetworkClientServer`, against a write-restricted token with a broker capability SID; pick the stronger
   one that passes 2–5) and reports it in its containment string; Core refuses a broker without it.
2. The broker cannot create or modify a file the user can write outside its runtime state (positive control: the
   PF-27-S07 broker can). Measured exception: delete in low-integrity folders (Known limits).
3. The broker cannot open another process of the user for any access beyond query-limited (control: it can today).
   Measured exception: `PROCESS_TERMINATE` (Known limits).
4. The broker cannot start a process through `Win32_Process.Create`, `Schedule.Service` or an out-of-process COM
   server (control: an unconfined process can).
5. The PF-27-S04/PF-28-S02/PF-33-S02 broker suite passes over the pipes; upstream TLS and DNS work; stored keys
   come from Credential Manager, read by the broker under its own token (decision (c)): the token can read it
   (measured); the Windows reader (`arg0`, vault lock file; none in `server.rs` yet) is PF-27-S09's.

## Test plan

- `pf_27_s08` probes (positive controls) on `windows-2022` and the Windows machine; tmux run, videos, one review.

## Decisions

- Token: write-restricted low-integrity token, not an AppContainer; PF-27-S07 holder start (evidence README).
- Key path: **(c), Travis, 2026-10-09**: the broker reads Credential Manager itself, as the macOS/Linux brokers read
  the OS keyring (PF-27-S05); PF-27-S09 ports S05. Accepted: a compromised broker can read and write the user's
  other generic credentials (and likely overwrite or delete them; see the evidence README).
- #333 merged with five checks pending; they passed later on main (`d0544c1c91`: windows-security-probes, CI).

## Done

- [x] Planned (2026-10-08); criteria 1–5 as amended, with positive controls, on `windows-2022` and the real
  machine (PR #333); key path decided 2026-10-09.
- [x] Real-Windows GLM 5.2 tmux run and SOP videos (2026-10-09).
- [x] Travis accepted the sprint with the known limits in the evidence README (2026-10-09); follow-ups under Closure.

## Remaining

None. Follow-ups are listed under Closure.

## Verification

- [x] Probes and suite on `windows-2022` and the real machine (elevated and normal session), 2026-10-09; rechecked
  on main `5d283fde18` (job 113966110399): `pf_27_s08` 7/7 and suite 25/25, both sessions.
- [x] Opus 5.5 High review: REQUEST_CHANGES (B1, B2), fixed in #333; scoped re-review 2026-10-09 confirmed both,
  docs corrections from it applied (`workers-20261002/pf27s08-review-s2`).
- [x] Travis accepted the gate evidence (2026-10-09); received by the P1 integration owner.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Outputs under `qa/security-levels/sprints/PF-27-S08/` (probes, gate run, videos, key-path decision).
- [x] Record archived (2026-10-09, after Travis's acceptance, by the P1 integration owner).
