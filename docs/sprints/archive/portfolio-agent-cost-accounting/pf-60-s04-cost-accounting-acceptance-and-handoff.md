# PF-60-S04 — Cost-accounting acceptance and handoff

**Status: completed** (accepted by Travis 2026-10-10 with known limits; see Closure). Travis asked for the accounting work to finish sprint by sprint with demo videos. Both S05 hand-overs are closed, and every cost flow passed on one recorded binary ([qualification](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/qualification.md)) and again in the independent code-blind acceptance. This was the last PF-60 sprint.

## Closure — 2026-10-10

Completed. Travis **accepted** PF-60-S04 on 2026-10-10 (in chat with the coordinator), with the documented known
limits, after the independent code-blind acceptance (PR #397, merge `d5004cfedf`). Archived by the accounting
integration owner.

**Decisions (Travis, 2026-10-10):**

- Accept S04. The acceptance run's NOT VERIFIABLE items stand as known limits: ChatGPT login, image generation,
  realtime and TensorCash. No enforced isolation gate was used, as in S05's waiver (b).
- Lift S05's waiver (a): the lane run and the independent run both recomputed the OpenAI API-key totals exactly
  (recorded as an addendum in [S05's Closure](pf-60-s05-collection-correctness-and-billing-basis.md)).
- Accept the remaining gaps, each carried into a draft follow-up sprint (below).

**Evidence:**

- [Qualification on one recorded binary](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/qualification.md), main
  `1e9cd464b9`; [demo index](../../../../qa/demos/index/PF-60-S04.md).
- [Independent code-blind acceptance](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s04/independent-acceptance-20261010/README.md),
  main `b1e20a8ec6` (same codex-rs as `1e9cd464b9`): every exercised criterion PASS and every pay-per-use total recomputed exactly; code-blind
  Opus 5.5 High [review](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s04/independent-acceptance-20261010/REVIEW.md):
  "Supported with corrections" (applied).
- PRs: #382 (`bda1b29d90`, activation), #383 (`be411b5ed7`, slice A), #385 (`1e9cd464b9`, slice B), #393
  (`b1e20a8ec6`, qualification and demos), #397 (`d5004cfedf`, independent acceptance).

**Known limits (carried, not discharged), each in a [follow-up sprint](../../../plans/active/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting-followups.md#sprint-execution-map):**

| Limit | Issue | Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guardian reviews of a `/side` conversation, and sub-agents started from one, are not recorded | #400 | PF-60-S06 |
| The `side:` label also covers other temporary forks, not only `/side` | #401 | PF-60-S06 |
| #368 price items: OpenRouter per-endpoint pricing, Moonshot/BigModel routes, `gpt-6.1-sol`, Sol promotion end 2026-11-21, DeepSeek holidays | #368 | PF-60-S07 |
| Unpriced request page shows "Cache write cost: $0.000000" | #396 | PF-60-S08 |
| Every OpenAI reopen sends a paid warm-up request (~$0.025 on `gpt-5.4`) | #403 | PF-60-S08 |
| "(pay per use (set in your config))" nested parentheses | #396 | PF-60-S08 |
| NOT VERIFIABLE: ChatGPT login, image generation, realtime, TensorCash | #402 | PF-60-S09 |
| No enforced isolation gate (S05 waiver (b), repeated here) | #404 | PF-60-S10 |

Collection stays developer-only (`developer-accounting`, debug builds); shipping `/cost` to users is not authorised.

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: `qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/qualification.md`; all cost flows pass on one recorded binary; unknown and estimated values stay visibly distinct.
- **Gap (i), close:** `/side` conversations and memory consolidation are paid but not recorded. Record them like guardian reviews: under the conversation they belong to, with a turn label naming what they are (`side:`, `consolidation:`). An ephemeral session with no persisted conversation behind it (`exec --ephemeral`) stays excluded with its one log warning.
- **Gap (ii), close:** a request with a billing basis but no price shows a "Price source" line and price metadata on its detail page, as if it had a price. Show plainly that it has no price and records only its basis.
- **(iii) AC10 waiver re-check:** S05's waiver (a) held until #361 was fixed; #369 merged. Re-run one real OpenAI API-key request on the final binary and recompute it at published prices. Pass lifts waiver (a) for Travis to confirm.
- **(iv) #368 price follow-ups:** documented as limitations only. They change prices, which this sprint excludes.
- Excludes: changing prices, rebilling historical customers, collecting prompts, restoring legacy Plan allowances, silently converting allowance to cash, shipping `/cost` to users.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Unified agent cost and usage accounting](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-10-portfolio-agent-cost-accounting.md); feature `PF-60`; acceptance: all cost flows pass on one recorded binary; unknown/estimated values remain visibly distinct.

## Code boundaries

- Gap (i): `core/src/session/mod.rs::accounting_owner`, `core/src/accounting.rs` (`AccountingOwner`, `attach_scopes` turn label), `core/src/accounting_extensions.rs` (extension labels), the consolidation agent's start in `memories/write/src/runtime.rs` and the hook it needs on `core/src/codex_thread.rs` / `core/src/state/service.rs`.
- Gap (ii): `tui/src/chatwidget/tokens.rs::attempt_text`.
- Evidence: `qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s04/`. The literal file list is `write_scope`.

## Preconditions

- [x] 2026-10-10 Plan active; S03 and S05 completed and archived; worktree, branch, 40-character base and literal write scope allocated and recorded in the plan; receiving owner named.
- [x] 2026-10-10 Inputs: vault labels `claude-plan-test-token`, `provider/zai_api_key`, `provider/kimi_api_key`, `openai-api-key`, used only in disposable homes with `CORBANU_TEST_NO_NATIVE_KEYRING=1`; small live spend only; no external writes or financial actions.

## Done

- [x] Draft sprint created and linked to one feature.
- [x] 2026-10-10 Activated with gaps (i)-(iv) folded in (PR #382, `bda1b29d90`).
- [x] 2026-10-10 **Slice A (gap i), PR #383 (`be411b5ed7`):** `/side` conversations record under their fork origin (`side:`) and memory consolidation under the conversation that started it (`consolidation:`, bound when the worker is built). Review: round 1 requested changes, round 2 APPROVE.
- [x] 2026-10-10 **Slice B (gap ii), PR #385 (`1e9cd464b9`):** a basis-only request's detail shows "Price: none recorded — this request records only its billing basis (…)" with no price metadata; plan-rate records keep it. Review: round 1 requested changes, round 2 APPROVE.
- [x] 2026-10-10 **Qualification** on one recorded binary (main `1e9cd464b9`, Linux debug, sha256 `cb378c27…a1d58`), with real keys through tmux: three-provider parent/child journeys (OpenAI `gpt-5.4` parent with Kimi, Claude and DeepSeek children; GLM 5.2 parent with Kimi and Claude children), `/side`, consolidation, cancellation, missing price, duplicate retry, reopen, kill -9 and restart, history, date bounds. Pay-per-use figures recompute exactly; seeded history matches its goldens ([qualification](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/qualification.md)).
- [x] 2026-10-10 **(iii)** OpenAI API-key estimate exact on 13 real requests: recommend lifting S05 waiver (a). **(iv)** #368 recorded as limitations.
- [x] 2026-10-10 Five demo videos ([index](../../../../qa/demos/index/PF-60-S04.md)); narrated reel built, not published.

- [x] 2026-10-10 **Independent code-blind acceptance** (PR #397): every exercised criterion PASS; #396 filed.
- [x] 2026-10-10 **Travis accepted** with known limits and lifted S05 waiver (a); follow-ups drafted; archived (Closure).

## Remaining

- [x] Independent code-blind acceptance, then Travis's named acceptance (waiver (a) decision); archive: done 2026-10-10 (Closure).

## Verification

- [x] Slice A: `just test -p codex-core --features developer-accounting -E 'test(accounting) | test(guardian)'` 329/329; without the feature 324/324; `just test -p codex-memories-write` 48/48.
- [x] Slice B: `just test -p codex-tui --features developer-accounting -E 'test(tokens) | test(cost) | test(accounting)'` 126/126; `just test -p codex-tui -E 'test(tokens) | test(cost)'` 113/113.
- [x] Each slice: Linux clippy `-D warnings` on the RTX box, with and without `developer-accounting`, 0/0 on the final heads; Opus 5.5 High review rounds ending in APPROVE.
- [x] Focused tmux: `CORBANU_TMUX_REQUIRED=1 just test -p codex-tui --test all tmux --retries 0` on `1e9cd464b9` (RTX; the recipe ran directly, as `just` isn't installed there): 71/71, 24 skipped.
- [x] Integration: `python3 docs/plans/check.py; python3 docs/sprints/check.py`; `git diff --check`: clean.
- [x] True TUI on the recorded binary: success, cancel, recovery/resume (kill -9) and historical inspection with actual keys.
- [x] Expected versus actual results and nonzero test counts recorded in the qualification; nothing unchecked converted into a pass.
- [x] Independent code-blind acceptance: an executor who reads only this record, the qualification and in-product help re-runs the flows with real keys and records pass/fail per flow; a code-blind reviewer audits it. — Done, PR #397: every exercised criterion PASS; ChatGPT login, image generation, realtime and TensorCash NOT VERIFIABLE; enforced isolation gate not used (known limit).

## Exit evidence

- [x] Output commit/digest and input provenance recorded; checks linked to that final tree ([build receipt](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s04/data/build-receipt.txt)).
- [x] Independent code-blind acceptance recorded; Travis accepts the bounded output. — PR #397; accepted 2026-10-10.
- [x] Handoff includes changed scope, contracts, known gaps and required combined-tree evidence (qualification, "Handoff").
- [x] Done/Remaining ledgers updated honestly; accepted record archived under `docs/sprints/archive/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/` and plan backlinks updated. — 2026-10-10.
