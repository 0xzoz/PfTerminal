# PF-52-S01 — Claude auth adapter

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: the merged Claude subscription choice/recovery backend behind the shared controller.
- Excludes: rewriting Claude credential discovery, source priority, or token custody.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Unified provider onboarding and management](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-14-unified-provider-auth.md).
- Feature: `PF-52`.
- Acceptance advanced: onboarding and `/providers` invoke exactly the qualified Claude flow.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: `claude_code_login.rs`, vault Claude auth, CLI helper, login external bearer.
- Planned: typed adapter from shared actions/effects to the existing Claude backend.
- Tests: managed-token, Claude Code login, cancel, conflict, 401, replace, restart, and redaction.

## Preconditions

- [x] Plan is active.
- [x] PF-51-S01 is completed and archived at `bd3b011a23`.
- [x] Exact serial allocation matches the plan.
- [x] PF-42–PF-47 invariants and evidence are reviewed before changing adapters.

## Done

- [x] Added the renderer-independent Claude account controller for method choice,
      managed-token entry, Claude Code login, retry, replace, cancellation, and PF-49 reconciliation.
- [x] Bound UnauthorizedRecovery to the qualified backend's selected Managed,
      Environment, or Claude Code source without fallback; PreserveSelected binds source and authority.
- [x] Made code submission the commit point; correlated timeout, stale, late,
      transport-loss, status, and adapter Ready/Finished ordering races are typed and tested.
- [x] Kept managed tokens, challenges, codes, backend text, and process output out
      of snapshots/history; the legacy onboarding send only adds the zeroizing input wrapper.
- [x] Added Cargo/Bazel registration and preserved PF-42–PF-47 discovery, priority,
      custody, atomic-selection, runtime-bearer, and metadata-only invariants.

## Remaining

- [x] Primary reviewed and integrated the final tree in implementation commit
      `a723374834`; this completed record is archived with no implementation item remaining.

## Verification

- [x] `just bazel-lock-update`, scoped `just fix`, escalated `just fmt`, and
      `git diff --check` passed. Sandboxed fmt alone was environment-blocked by read-only uv cache.
- [x] Zero-retry suites passed: provider-auth 49; TUI adapter 5; full Claude backend
      30; vault Claude 21; login bearer cache 2; login UnauthorizedRecovery 1; CLI health 5.
- [x] `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo check -p codex-tui` passed. The first CLI filter
      selected zero tests; corrected `platform_fixture_health` passed all five binaries.
- [x] Governance passed: plans 2/2 active, sprints 63 current/107 archived,
      portable skills 25; production canary scan returned no matches.
- [x] Final production lines stay below 500: auth_flow 494, lib 491, Claude flow
      423, controller 484, settlement 421, TUI adapter 285.
- [x] Primary reran the final provider-auth 49/49 and TUI adapter 5/5 suites
      on the integrated tree and confirmed the recorded evidence.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Final changed implementation paths are Cargo.lock; provider-auth lib/auth_flow
      plus Claude flow/controller/settlement/tests; TUI Cargo/BUILD, chatwidget
      adapter/backend/tests, and onboarding's wrapper-only send.
- [x] PF-42–PF-47 compatibility is covered by the vault/login/CLI suites above;
      no historical evidence was invalidated.
- [x] `Done` and `Remaining` reflect the primary-review-ready tree.
- [x] Implementation commit `a723374834` is recorded and this completed record is archived.
