# PF-51-S01 — OpenAI account auth adapter

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: OpenAI browser/device account login as an adapter on the shared controller.
- Excludes: changing app-server login protocol, account policy, or API-key behavior.

## Plan linkage

- Active plan feature: `PF-51`; acceptance is shared host login semantics.

## Code boundaries

- Provider-auth controller plus thin app-server-client adapter and tests only.

## Preconditions

- [x] Plan is active.
- [x] PF-50-S01 is completed and archived.
- [x] Exact serial allocation matches the plan.
- [x] Existing app-server request/cancel semantics are preserved.

## Done

- [x] Draft sprint record created and linked to PF-51.
- [x] Added typed OpenAI actions/effects, secret-free snapshots, completion,
      recovery, and a thin app-server-client adapter without protocol changes.
- [x] Preserved browser/device login and device-only forced enrollment.
- [x] Added dual correlation, cancellation, stale rejection, PF-49 status
      settlement, restart recovery, redaction, and audit-race regressions.

## Remaining

- [x] Committed accepted implementation `13dcc188fb`, reran post-commit governance, and archived PF-51.

## Verification

- [x] Post-commit plan/sprint validators and clean-tree check passed.

## Implementation and audit evidence

- Exact mappings are `Chatgpt`, `ChatgptDeviceCode`, and device-only
  `OpenaiProviderDeviceCode`; forced browser enrollment is typed-rejected.
- API-key status never satisfies account setup. Late cancellation, wrong
  login-bearing variants, transport uncertainty, and non-account settlement
  terminate through typed cancel/failure/recovery paths without orphaned login.
- Challenges are zeroizing, non-serializable, non-cloneable, and Debug-redacted;
  arbitrary server error text is discarded.
- Final production sizes after formatting: `openai_account_controller.rs` 489
  lines, `openai_account_flow.rs` 494 lines, and app-server-client
  `provider_auth.rs` 195 lines.
- Provider-auth passed 40/40; adapter 8/8; protocol filters 5/5 and 1/1; forced
  device app-server integration 1/1 (`ddafa2de-88bf-4c2a-be74-93009c91f47d`);
  TUI check passed. Fix/fmt/Bazel/governance/diff/canary checks passed.
- Changed paths are the scoped Cargo lock/manifest, app-server-client
  lib/adapter/tests, provider-auth lib/shared controller/OpenAI modules/tests,
  and this ledger. Bazel lock and BUILD required no diff.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Implementation commit `13dcc188fb`; app-server adapter contract recorded.
- [x] Final-tree tests linked.
- [x] Cancel/stale notification evidence recorded.
- [x] `Done` and `Remaining` reflect pre-commit reality.
- [x] Completed record archived under `docs/sprints/archive/unified-provider-auth/`.
