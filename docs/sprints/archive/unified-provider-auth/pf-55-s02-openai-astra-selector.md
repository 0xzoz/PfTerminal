# PF-55-S02 — OpenAI Astra model selector

## Execution mandate

- Add `gpt-6-astra` to OpenAI's bundled manual model selector, with sourced
  capabilities and supported reasoning levels. Preserve current/default model.
- Exclude automatic model allocation, guessed billing, Corbanu API/Bedrock routes,
  credential changes, provider fallback, actual paid inference and publication.

## Plan linkage

- [Unified provider authentication](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-14-unified-provider-auth.md),
  feature `PF-55`, explicitly amended by the user's 2026-09-05 model request.
- Product citation: **Shipping MVP — LIVE**, “OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude Plan, Kimi,
  Z.AI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ambient, Meta, Baseten, Vercel, Bedrock, Ollama,
  LM Studio, Corbanu Plan, and custom providers.”
- The existing provider/model routing, persistence and native Responses interfaces
  remain authoritative. Upstream baseline `ba6cf9c69277caec51a4c12c5b7401a9920930e0`
  is unchanged; no upstream merge or new runtime adapter is planned.

## Code boundaries

- Bundled catalog in models-manager; existing catalog/auth/cache behavior tests.
- Existing model-picker snapshots and provider-management TMUX fixture for exact
  Astra selection, cancellation, restart and loopback Responses request assertions.
- No credentials, security broker paths or other active sprint scopes overlap.

## Preconditions

- [x] User request and product linkage recorded in active plan; prior sprint archived.
- [x] Root, Rust, TUI policies and development/test-tui skills read; clean receiving tree.
- [x] OpenAI Docs fetched exact Astra model and migration parameter pages; no API-key
  setup tool is available, and no real API key is needed for loopback fixtures.

## Done

- [x] Confirmed missing bundled Astra entry and existing generic OpenAI route mapping.
- [x] Added sourced catalog entry and regression/snapshot/TMUX coverage.
- [x] Final scoped fix/format and 87 selected tests pass without retries.
- [x] Manual `just codex` verified Astra, Max, cancellation and saved High selection.
- [x] User documentation and exact source/binary/test evidence recorded.

## Remaining

None within PF-55-S02. Real account entitlement and broader release gates are
separate, explicitly disclosed in the evidence record.

## Verification

- [x] Scoped fix/format, model-manager tests and relevant TUI snapshots pass.
- [x] Real TMUX selection/cancel/restart and exact loopback model/effort request pass.
- [x] Manual `just codex` with temporary home, explicit trace log directory and fake auth.
- [x] Governance, portable-skill parity and final diff checks pass.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Source/docs and test commands/results in `qa/release/0.1.38/astra-selector.md`.
- [x] TensorCash/Isometric applicability: not a project coding-logic change; isolated
  selection/persistence/loopback routing proves this feature. Broader release-level
  live-repository, benchmark, cross-platform and named-human gates remain separate.
- [x] Completed sprint archived for integration handoff; no release or paid access claim.

Implementation commit: `6b17a2630f31f5447d2c53fa8f6a29b60407b42a`.
Final nextest run: `a6f3821f-aa09-49d0-a435-210c7c210586`, 87/87 passed.
[Evidence](../../../../qa/release/0.1.38/astra-selector.md).
