# PF-55-S03 — Live Astra runtime compatibility

## Execution mandate

- Deliver working `gpt-6-astra` in Corbanu, with any required upstream upgrade,
  a repeatable live harness and actual TUI proof. Mocks alone cannot qualify it.
- Preserve the reconciled provider/credential fixes, current profile and other
  providers. No release, new credential copying, payments or fallback model.

## Plan linkage

- [Unified provider authentication](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-14-unified-provider-auth.md), PF-55.
- Product: **Shipping MVP — LIVE**, “Multi-provider inference”; **Product
  principles**, “Maintain continuous Codex parity without removing Corbanu-specific behavior.”
- User mandate: live Astra failed with a newer-Codex error; do the necessary
  upgrade and test the real harness in TUI before claiming it works.

## Code boundaries

- Existing model-provider compatibility headers, bundled catalog and manager
  merge behavior; shared model protocol metadata and native login user-agent.
- Typed request/metadata regression fixtures and real TMUX acceptance script.
- Upstream baseline `ba6cf9c69277caec51a4c12c5b7401a9920930e0`; candidate
  `rust-v0.153.4` = `3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a` fetched from
  `https://github.com/openai/codex.git`. Exact integration disposition required.
- Wider Core/protocol changes or full upstream merge require explicit scope
  amendment and disjoint allocation before editing, not a change in the goal.

## Preconditions

- [x] User-authorized upgrade and live inference recorded; active plan updated.
- [x] Receiving branch is clean at the recorded base; prior sprint is archived.
- [x] Root/Rust/TUI/Core policies, development/test-TUI skills, OpenAI Docs and
  model-migration reference read. No API-key setup tool is available.
- [x] Current scope does not overlap active PF-27-S04/PF-35-S01 paths.

## Done

- [x] Confirmed local compatibility `0.144.1` and exact upstream Astra minimum
  `0.153.0`, native Code Mode/Responses Lite/unified-execution metadata.
- [x] Preserved user-provided 400 as failed live acceptance, not an auth failure.
- [x] Integrated the native Astra contract and shared discovery/inference version;
  preserved template-only instructions through personality overrides.
- [x] Added native request/header regressions and an opt-in structured live TUI
  harness. Final affected Rust checks: 445/445; harness checks: 12/12.
- [x] First live TensorCash diagnostic passed real Astra file/tool work,
  Escape cancellation/recovery and process restart/same-thread resume.
- [x] Final installed binary passed both pinned disposable repositories: 18 real
  Astra responses, 12 paired tool calls, cancellation/recovery and same-thread resume.
- [x] Installed `corbanu-debug --yolo` with the approved normal profile; restarted
  only `corbanu-test` and verified the running executable and Astra/medium footer.
- [x] Committed and pushed runtime/harness source `f848954d7739da8eaa4962f0866c612dedbaf5bb`;
  documented exact artifacts, compatibility disposition and remaining release limits.

## Remaining

None. Named-human acceptance and unrelated release/benchmark gates are disclosed
in the evidence record; they are not claimed as completed by this sprint.

## Verification

- [x] Model/provider/login/protocol and affected TUI regression checks pass.
- [x] Full Core run not applicable: no Core production adapter or serialized
  schema changed. Filtered tests are disclosed, not counted as passes.
- [x] True TUI final-binary live Astra tool/cancel/restart/resume evidence passes.
- [x] Model identity and real response/tool events are asserted, not inferred
  from echoed prompts, picker labels or success strings in a mocked server.
- [x] Governance, portable skills and final diff checks pass.

## Exit evidence

- [x] `qa/release/0.1.38/astra-runtime.md` records source/upstream disposition,
  commands, hashes, actual runs and limitations. Prior selector evidence stays historical.
- [x] Reported client rejection resolved in installed candidate; named-human follow-up
  and unrelated release/benchmark/cross-platform gates remain honestly disclosed.
- [x] Completed sprint archived only after all live acceptance requirements pass.
