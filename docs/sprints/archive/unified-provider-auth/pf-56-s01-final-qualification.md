# PF-56-S01 — Unified provider final qualification

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: formatted integrated candidate with bounded reviews, extensive TMUX, docs, and release evidence.
- Excludes: waiving live-account, human, platform, benchmark, or release gates.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Unified provider onboarding and management](../../../plans/completed/main-2026-10-14-unified-provider-auth.md).
- Feature: `PF-56`.
- Acceptance advanced: the complete P1 feature is fit for purpose on the final tree.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: all PF-48–PF-55 changed paths, TUI TMUX harness, provider docs, QA/release records.
- Planned: final regression matrix, artifacts, review dispositions, finished docs, and release linkage.
- Tests: complete automated, adversarial, PTY, live-repository, restart/resume, and platform matrix.

## Preconditions

- [x] Plan is active.
- [x] PF-55-S01 and every predecessor are completed and archived; PF-55 implementation is `21cf3199f2` and archive is `5a1fd449e7`.
- [x] Exact serial allocation matches the plan and retains the GPT-5.6 Sol high implementation owner.
- [x] Candidate `21cf3199f2`, disposable TensorCash worktree `/home/pfrpc/repos/worktrees/pf56-tensorcash-dd6e9202` at `dd6e92024254090de0f596b090bd5c74c4d97b90`, disposable Isometric Game worktree `/home/pfrpc/repos/worktrees/pf56-isometricgame-59821b7a` at `59821b7a85524f186f946c4670480c7ee96483cb`, pending live-account/platform/release gates, and the user-authorized Kimi 3.0 high through Vercel reviewer runtime are recorded. The single attempted Fable invocation failed authentication before inference and is retained only as superseded evidence.

## Done

- [x] Draft sprint record created and linked to PF-56.
- [x] Allocated serially at post-PF-55 archive commit `5a1fd449e7` with literal test, documentation, QA-ledger, and review scope.
- [x] Expanded remediation scope to the six exact shared policy/settlement paths named by the completed Kimi review; each finding must be reproduced before repair, and unrelated production edits remain excluded.
- [x] Expanded scope to `tui/src/provider_auth_effect_executor.rs` after reproduction proved a reducer terminal failure alone would leave the API-key executor awaiting its retained action channel; the addition is limited to correlated failed-snapshot settlement and focused tests.
- [x] Expanded scope to `tui/src/model_catalog.rs` and its adjacent tests after strengthened TMUX proved successful same-session reactivation refreshed eligibility but could not restore a custom provider absent from the bootstrap-only preset list; the repair is limited to idempotent exact-runtime model synchronization before policy refresh.

- [x] Ran fixes/formatting and all affected crate, integration, snapshot, migration, schema, redaction, and canary tests.
- [x] Executed the final 26/26 serial true-TMUX matrix for multi-provider, OpenAI, Claude, API keys, custom providers, deferred Corbanu, eligibility, current replacement, failure/cancel, restart/resume.
- [x] Ran real workflows in clean disposable TensorCash and Isometric Game worktrees.
- [x] Completed the sole external review with Kimi 3.0 high through Vercel in TMUX, stayed below the four-review maximum, retained the pre-inference Fable OAuth failure as superseded evidence, and dispositioned every finding.
- [x] Updated finished provider/auth docs only after candidate behavior was verified.
- [x] Recorded open named-human, live-account, physical-platform, upstream, release, and benchmark evidence as shipment blockers without fabricating a pass.

## Remaining

None for PF-56's implementation and automated qualification scope. Open shipment
evidence remains at the active-plan level: named human acceptance, live eligible
accounts, required physical-platform confirmation, final upstream disposition,
target version/integration commit/merge/tag/release ledger, and benchmark
due-state were not fabricated.

## Verification

- [x] Primary reran post-documentation formatting, diff, plan, and sprint governance gates and inspected the final signed-scope diff without a blocking issue.
- [x] Primary verified signed implementation commit `fd8a9c900e` and its remote push before archiving the sprint.

## Exit evidence

- [x] Signed implementation commit `fd8a9c900e` records the PF-56 repairs, tests, documentation, review disposition, and qualification ledger; version, scope checkpoints, and binary hash are recorded in the QA ledger.
- [x] Final-tree outputs, TMUX bundles, live-repository bases, and canary scans are linked in `qa/provider-auth/pf-56/qualification.md`.
- [x] The four-review maximum, sole completed external review, superseded Fable attempt, and every finding disposition are recorded.
- [x] Named-human and release evidence remains explicitly blocked without a pass claim.
- [x] `Done` and `Remaining` reflect reality.
- [x] Completed record is archived after the verified implementation commit and remote push.
